       "'[[ UPDATE - 6/19/2014 ]]So my lovely wife bought me a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 for Father\\'s Day and I\\'ve been loving it ever since.  Just as other with Samsung products, the Galaxy Tab 4 has the ability to add a microSD card to expand the memory on the device.  Since it\\'s been over a year, I decided to do some more research to see if SanDisk offered anything new.  As of 6/19/2014, their product lineup for microSD cards from worst to best (performance-wise) are the as follows:SanDiskSanDisk UltraSanDisk Ultra PLUSSanDisk ExtremeSanDisk Extreme PLUSSanDisk Extreme PRONow, the difference between all of these cards are simply the speed in which you can read/write data to the card.  Yes, the published rating of most all these cards (except the SanDisk regular) are Class 10/UHS-I but that\\'s just a rating... Actual real world performance does get better with each model, but with faster cards come more expensive prices.  Since Amazon doesn\\'t carry the Ultra PLUS model of microSD card, I had to do direct comparisons between the SanDisk Ultra ($34.27), Extreme ($57.95), and Extreme PLUS ($67.95).As mentioned in my earlier review, I purchased the SanDisk Ultra for my Galaxy S4.  My question was, did I want to pay over $20 more for a card that is faster than the one I already owned?  Or I could pay almost double to get SanDisk\\'s 2nd-most fastest microSD card.The Ultra works perfectly fine for my style of usage (storing/capturing pictures & HD video and movie playback) on my phone.  So in the end, I ended up just buying another SanDisk Ultra 64GB card.  I use my cell phone *more* than I do my tablet and if the card is good enough for my phone, it\\'s good enough for my tablet.  I don\\'t own a 4K HD camera or anything like that, so I honestly didn\\'t see a need to get one of the faster cards at this time.I am now a proud owner of 2 SanDisk Ultra cards and have absolutely 0 issues with it in my Samsung devices.[[ ORIGINAL REVIEW - 5/1/2013 ]]I haven\\'t had to buy a microSD card in a long time. The last time I bought one was for my cell phone over 2 years ago. But since my cellular contract was up, I knew I would have to get a newer card in addition to my new phone, the Samsung Galaxy S4. Reason for this is because I knew my small 16GB microSD card wasn\\'t going to cut it.Doing research on the Galaxy S4, I wanted to get the best card possible that had decent capacity (32 GB or greater). This led me to find that the Galaxy S4 supports the microSDXC Class 10 UHS-I card, which is the fastest possible given that class. Searching for that specifically on Amazon gave me results of only 3 vendors (as of April) that makes these microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 cards. They are Sandisk (the majority), Samsung and Lexar. Nobody else makes these that are sold on Amazon.Seeing how SanDisk is a pretty good name out of the 3 (I\\'ve used them the most), I decided upon the SanDisk because Lexar was overpriced and the Samsung one was overpriced (as well as not eligible for Amazon Prime).But the scary thing is that when you filter by the SanDisk, you literally get DOZENS of options. All of them have different model numbers, different sizes, etc. Then there\\'s that confusion of what\\'s the difference between SDHC & SDXC?SDHC vs SDXC:SDHC stand for \"Secure Digital High Capacity\" and SDXC stands for \"Secure Digital eXtended Capacity\". Essentially these two cards are the same with the exception that SDHC only supports capcities up to 32GB and is formated with the FAT32 file system. The SDXC cards are formatted with the exFAT file system. If you use an SDXC card in a device, it must support that file system, otherwise it may not be recognizable and/or you have to reformat the card to FAT32.FAT32 vs exFAT:The differences between the two file systems means that FAT32 has a maximum file size of 4GB, limited by that file system. exFAT on the otherhand, supports file sizes up to 2TB (terabytes). The only thing you need to know here really is that it\\'s possible your device doesn\\'t support exFAT. If that\\'s the case, just reformat it to FAT32. REMEMBER FORMATTING ERASES ALL DATA!To clarify the model numbers, I I hopped over to the SanDisk official webpage. What I found there is that they offer two \"highspeed\" options for SanDisk cards. These are SanDisk Extreme Pro and SanDisk Ultra. SanDisk Extreme Pro is a line that supports read speeds up to 95MB/sec, however they are SDHC only. To make things worse, they are currently only available in 16GB & 8GB capacities. Since one of my requirements was to have a lot of storage, I ruled these out.The remaining devices listed on Amazon\\'s search were the SanDisk Ultra line. But here, confusion sets in because SanDisk separates these cards to two different devices. Cameras & mobile devices. Is there a real difference between the two or is this just a marketing stunt? Unfortunately I\\'m not sure but I do know the price difference between the two range from a couple cents to a few dollars. Since I wasn\\'t sure, I opted for the one specifically targeted for mobile devices (just in case there is some kind of compatibility issue). To find the exact model number, I would go to Sandisk\\'s webpage (sandisk.com) and compare their existing product lineup. From there, you get exact model numbers and you can then search Amazon for these model numbers. That is how I got mine (SDSDQUA-064G).As for speed tests, I haven\\'t run any specific testing, but copying 8 GB worth of data from my PC to the card literally took just a few minutes.One last note is that Amazon attaches additional characters to the end (for example SDSDQUA-064G-AFFP-A vs SDSDQUA-064G-U46A). The difference between the two is that the \"AFFP-A\" means \"Amazon Frustration Free Packaging\". Other than that, these are exactly the same.  If you\\'re wondering what I got (and want to use it in your Galaxy S4), I got the SDSDQUA-064G-u46A and it works like charm.'"

       "'   UPDATE               So my lovely wife bought me a Samsung Galaxy Tab   for Father s Day and I ve been loving it ever since   Just as other with Samsung products  the Galaxy Tab   has the ability to add a microSD card to expand the memory on the device   Since it s been over a year  I decided to do some more research to see if SanDisk offered anything new   As of            their product lineup for microSD cards from worst to best  performance wise  are the as follows SanDiskSanDisk UltraSanDisk Ultra PLUSSanDisk ExtremeSanDisk Extreme PLUSSanDisk Extreme PRONow  the difference between all of these cards are simply the speed in which you can read write data to the card   Yes  the published rating of most all these cards  except the SanDisk regular  are Class    UHS I but that s just a rating    Actual real world performance does get better with each model  but with faster cards come more expensive prices   Since Amazon doesn t carry the Ultra PLUS model of microSD card  I had to do direct comparisons between the SanDisk Ultra           Extreme           and Extreme PLUS          As mentioned in my earlier review  I purchased the SanDisk Ultra for my Galaxy S    My question was  did I want to pay over     more for a card that is faster than the one I already owned   Or I could pay almost double to get SanDisk s  nd most fastest microSD card The Ultra works perfectly fine for my style of usage  storing capturing pictures   HD video and movie playback  on my phone   So in the end  I ended up just buying another SanDisk Ultra   GB card   I use my cell phone  more  than I do my tablet and if the card is good enough for my phone  it s good enough for my tablet   I don t own a  K HD camera or anything like that  so I honestly didn t see a need to get one of the faster cards at this time I am now a proud owner of   SanDisk Ultra cards and have absolutely   issues with it in my Samsung devices    ORIGINAL REVIEW              I haven t had to buy a microSD card in a long time  The last time I bought one was for my cell phone over   years ago  But since my cellular contract was up  I knew I would have to get a newer card in addition to my new phone  the Samsung Galaxy S   Reason for this is because I knew my small   GB microSD card wasn t going to cut it Doing research on the Galaxy S   I wanted to get the best card possible that had decent capacity     GB or greater   This led me to find that the Galaxy S  supports the microSDXC Class    UHS I card  which is the fastest possible given that class  Searching for that specifically on Amazon gave me results of only   vendors  as of April  that makes these microSDXC Class    UHS   cards  They are Sandisk  the majority   Samsung and Lexar  Nobody else makes these that are sold on Amazon Seeing how SanDisk is a pretty good name out of the    I ve used them the most   I decided upon the SanDisk because Lexar was overpriced and the Samsung one was overpriced  as well as not eligible for Amazon Prime  But the scary thing is that when you filter by the SanDisk  you literally get DOZENS of options  All of them have different model numbers  different sizes  etc  Then there s that confusion of what s the difference between SDHC   SDXC SDHC vs SDXC SDHC stand for  Secure Digital High Capacity  and SDXC stands for  Secure Digital eXtended Capacity   Essentially these two cards are the same with the exception that SDHC only supports capcities up to   GB and is formated with the FAT   file system  The SDXC cards are formatted with the exFAT file system  If you use an SDXC card in a device  it must support that file system  otherwise it may not be recognizable and or you have to reformat the card to FAT   FAT   vs exFAT The differences between the two file systems means that FAT   has a maximum file size of  GB  limited by that file system  exFAT on the otherhand  supports file sizes up to  TB  terabytes   The only thing you need to know here really is that it s possible your device doesn t support exFAT  If that s the case  just reformat it to FAT    REMEMBER FORMATTING ERASES ALL DATA To clarify the model numbers  I I hopped over to the SanDisk official webpage  What I found there is that they offer two  highspeed  options for SanDisk cards  These are SanDisk Extreme Pro and SanDisk Ultra  SanDisk Extreme Pro is a line that supports read speeds up to   MB sec  however they are SDHC only  To make things worse  they are currently only available in   GB    GB capacities  Since one of my requirements was to have a lot of storage  I ruled these out The remaining devices listed on Amazon s search were the SanDisk Ultra line  But here  confusion sets in because SanDisk separates these cards to two different devices  Cameras   mobile devices  Is there a real difference between the two or is this just a marketing stunt  Unfortunately I m not sure but I do know the price difference between the two range from a couple cents to a few dollars  Since I wasn t sure  I opted for the one specifically targeted for mobile devices  just in case there is some kind of compatibility issue   To find the exact model number  I would go to Sandisk s webpage  sandisk com  and compare their existing product lineup  From there  you get exact model numbers and you can then search Amazon for these model numbers  That is how I got mine  SDSDQUA    G  As for speed tests  I haven t run any specific testing  but copying   GB worth of data from my PC to the card literally took just a few minutes One last note is that Amazon attaches additional characters to the end  for example SDSDQUA    G AFFP A vs SDSDQUA    G U  A   The difference between the two is that the  AFFP A  means  Amazon Frustration Free Packaging   Other than that  these are exactly the same   If you re wondering what I got  and want to use it in your Galaxy S    I got the SDSDQUA    G u  A and it works like charm '"

      "i bought   gb version of the card to use with gopro hero   black edition   it didn t work out   the card worked ok if camera was set to resolution with lower bit rates   e g  worked fine in    p with protune on  or     p with protune off   however  in     p with protune on  bitrate is just shy of   mb s in this mode    much higher then with protune turned off  it was nothing but trouble   camera would sometime work  and sometime randomly stop recording for no obvious reason   i first suspected camera  but testing with different sd cards  it ended up being sandisk s card that was at fault   my spare card  an old and cheap   gb pny  also class      worked just fine under same conditions and with same camera settings once it was obvious it was problem with the card  i found people on gopro s forums that had trouble with this specific card as well  well  you always find these only after you figure it out for yourself  right     anyhow  i did some speed tests with the card by doing simple write of  gb file full of zeros using unix dd utility to copy  gb of zeros from  dev zero  where else would you find that many zeros     onto a file on the card   the result was that on average  sandisk s card would manage about      mb s   just barely above the bar for class    card   however  that was average over  gb   during the write test  the speed was oscillating with many spikes and drops   drops were as low as  mb s   uh   i thought write speed of class    card should never dip below    mb s   for comparison  my old cheap class    pny card was chugging along at constant    mb s under the same test   no spikes and no drops in speed the card will probably work fine in most devices  as bitrates when recording     p video are often low enough and or camera might have huge buffer   but if you want to use it to record video at high bitrates  and your device doesn t have huge buffer to compensate for speed bumps of this card  you may run into trouble   be wary of using it in hero  in modes that have higher bit rates  e g      p with protune enabled  sandisk s website lists part numbers as sdsdqui    g with adapter  and sdsdqua    g without adapter   this conflicts with product description on amazon   while this is likely just amazon not getting product description right again  a bit too common thing   it s interesting to note  update apr          some numbers from testing the card   the test is extremely simple   write out  gb of zeros onto the card using standard unix dd command to read    kb blocks of zeroes from special device  dev zero and write it onto the card      kb           gb   dd displays transfer stats once it finishes   while dd was running  i run iostat in second terminal displaying   second interval stats as a measure of current speed   this was done on the mac   dd command line can be used as is to repeat test on linux system  however iostat command is different on linux and would need to be modified slightly   i choose    kb block size  as that seems to be what device drivers merges sequential writes into anyhow   using different block sizes  results are comparable   dd if  dev zero of test bs        count            records in       records out           bytes transferred in            secs           bytes sec so     mb s and all is good  right  wrong  iostat running in parallel with above dd command recorded this   iostat  d  w   disk disk kb t tps mb s                                                                                                                                          and so on until dd finishes writing  gb of zeros to the card      imo  the last column should never dip under   mb s for card labeled class    for comparison  same test run against samsung pro   gb micro sd card   dd if  dev zero of test bs        count            records in       records out           bytes transferred in           secs           bytes sec   iostat  d  w   disk disk kb t tps mb s                                                                                                                                                      and so on until dd finishes writing  gb of zeros to the card      so  samsung is on average  x faster  but more importantly it s speed is much more constant   and critically important  it never dips under   mb s \n",
      "what else to say about this sandisk ultra    gb micro sd xc   just perfect as all sandisk cards\n",
      "my husband and i bought this for our gopro and we used to to record our vacation to mexico  we still have more than half of the space left \n",

      "works perfectly and for a fair price  it is immediately recognized by any device you use it   good purchase \n",
      "needs little to no formatting and i have yet to see a sandisk fail  don t cut corners  almost every other brand of sd cards will fail on you except these  tried numerous brands with my devices  just remember it takes a bit for devices to buffer the information off of the sd card and static can corrupt any sd card which is usually easily fixed with a formatting  always back up your documents to a pc mac as soon as possible oh  and if you create playlists  slideshows  etc  on devices and remove the sd card  the device will not be smart enough to re compile it after you put the sd card back in and you will end up with blank playlists even though you have the songs so watch out lastly if this sd card doesn t work for you for whatever reason google sd card formatting and it should help you out  these   gb versions don t seem to have formatting issues like the   gb ones do but even then formatting to fat   fixes it \n",
      "sandisk is a company you can trust and offering such a good product at a low price comes with an adapter and small case to get full sd card size and keep it from getting lost when not in use \n",
      "appears to be class     holds about as much as it says it does  came with an sd card adapter and they even gave me the option to forgo those ridiculous plastic packages that you all know and hate  the ones that the scissors refuse to cut and you just end up hurting yourself a few times before getting it open  completely as advertised \n",
      "i bought this card for my gopro hero   and it was worked fine  some people said they have problems with the cards in the new gopros but i have had no such problems  the micro card works with anything that also takes standard cards due to the included adapter \n",
      "have always had good experiences with sandisk products   this was priced well   i have installed it in my wife s cell phone and it was immediately  recognized   not quite sure about the features this chip is supposed to have but for the amount of memory it was a good deal   extra features or not \n",
      "comes with a nice little adapter for your microsdhc so you can use it as a normal size sd card also  pretty neat considering for the price at     for   gb is pretty reasonable class    is fast for any hd     p video recording or dslr camera i bought this for myself to use with the gopro    taking picture   videos working great as it didn t give anycorrupted files videos   pictures yet  its working pretty good  san disk is a pretty reliable brand as you won t be able to go wrong with it \n",

      "cannot go wrong with sandisk and to date it works as advertised  the price wasn t a great cost savings but because it came from amazon which has a great reputation to date as far as i am concerned  i purchased through them \n",
      "awesome card   glad to be able to use it with my dslr \n",
      "great storage size  being the first adopter when it came out  thought the sale price      is excellent  got duped  it s been the same price since it was first introduced  great for the action cam  battery ran out before it ran out of memory \n",

      "does exactly what i needed it to do for galaxy s   word of warning   with kitkat it prevents apps from editing  changing  deleting anything on your sd card  stock apps that come with the phone can but downloaded ones are not able to  the trick if you have pics movies or whatever is to copy them to the phones internal storage and delete from there  until they fix it or come up with a non root work around for the operating system \n",
      "worked great in my galaxy s   until it didn t work at all for some unknown reason  used it for about   months before it crapped out  back up your data with all these things  though    \n",

      "it is handy    gb is a good size  even though many devices claim only to support up to    gb card  many of them actually do support   g card i like sandisk  it is a brand you can always trust  not saying they dont have lemon but it s happened to everything  \n",

      "it is very good  thanks sandisk you must have it with gopro cam to get the benefit of cam  yap \n",
      "i use this for a raspberry pi  in the sd adapter  and it works so far also appeared to be the genuine part  although the prolific sandisk counterfeiters have gotten really sneaky in recent years i like getting microsdhc cards because they can be adapted to different device sizes   for example  let s say i buy a used phone or e reader that needs a memory card  and i m not using my pi    i can just take the pi s card  take it out of the adapter  and put it in the other device  rather than pay more money and wait a week for delivery of a new one \n",
      "just popped it in and moved some apps to the card and works great   video is handled quickly and all apps start fast \n",

      "this micro sd card is perfect for any smartphone user looking to expand the storage on their device  i personally am using one in my samsung galaxy note    works like a charm  it is adequately fast  cheap  and fairly reliable  if you are looking for extremely fast speeds however  you should consider the sandisk extreme series which are the fastest microsd cards in the world  my card came with an adapter that this card plugs into and it becomes a full sized sd card  if you are looking to use this in a camera or any other device that uses sd cards  please look elsewhere  these cards are not nearly as fast as the full sized sd cards used in cameras  the adapter should only be used for transporting data from the phone or other device  to a computer  all in all  these are a great buy for any smartphone user looking for a higher storage capacity  the price fluctuates often  so catch em while there cheep  i got mine for around     \n",
      "i bought this on august of        as of april      the card stopped functioning   it can still be read  but the writing capability is gone   that s less than one year   i m extremely disappointed in the longevity of this card   my usage of it has been on my galaxy s    i have about   gb of data in it   guess i m going to have to look for another card that has a longer lifespan than this one \n",
      "why would you get anything less     gb of instantaneous movies  video  music or pictures   if you have an android phone that s capable of accepting micro sd cards go ahead and get you one or two \n",
      "i originally bought an off brand card for my new gs  because the price seemed so good  then  the day after i took a lot of pictures   they all mysteriously vanished    so  since i ve had only good experiences with sandisk in the past  i immediately found this card  which i was happy was on sale at the time  and bought it  i ve had absolutely no problems and i expect it to continue working for a long time  knock on wood bottom linethis is a quality product  don t buy cards without a respectable brand name \n",
      "i routinely use sdxc cards up to    gb  and this card was unreadable on arrival   both of my pcs said it needed to be formatted  and as a last resort i let one of them try  windows   i with up to date sdxc drivers   and it could not format it   it s on its way back to amazon   i m glad their returns are so easy \n",
      "always good  what else can i say  \n",
      "works as expected   based on price and performance this may be a best of breed product   i have found the sandisk brand to be dependable \n",
      "it is a memory card  fast as any other class   card  and sandisk units rarely lose data   i wish these guys would keep their marketing on the backside leaving some white space on top so we could write things   the cheapo brands do this but not the big guys   idiots \n",
      "so this product is a large disappointment   bought it to use in my tablet but the card is forever getting corrupted    i ve reformatted the card a few times but it s to the point now that even a reformat doesn t work    wasted money   don t recommend purchasing \n",
      "my first card ordered was bad   my tablet and my computer wouldn t write to it  wouldn t read it  amazon replaced it immediately and my new card is perfect  reads and writes very fast  much faster than the hc in my phone  i m glad i got the hc   for my tablet \n",
      "i purchased this and could not get it to work  then i discovered that sandisk has an app for it  so if you are stressing over this not working in your android device no worries go get the app it will work \n",
      "as usual anything from san dish is a quality product   bought to use with my surface pro   works as described and fast connection \n",
      "i purchased   of these and am very happy with both  good transfer rates  i found my last sd card caused the camera in my phone to delay when taking shots  but this one allows my phone to take pic s very quickly    \n",
      "bought this for my wife s samsung tl     which kept locking up with a lesser speed sd card  after throwing this card in there  the camera rarely locks up when taking pictures back to back  if you are shooting     mp and taking pictures back to back or shooting hd vid  it s a good idea to upgrade to a class    card \n",
      "my samsung galaxy note   came with   gigs of internal memory  i discovered that apps can only be written to the internal   gigs of memory so i didn t want to fill up the internal memory with pictures  videos  music  etc   i purchased the    gb san disk ultra microsdxc class    card  i found a video on youtube to learn how to insert the card since i could find nothing on it in the phone s user guide   it s real easy  turn the note phone off  remove the note s back plate  you see a plaque saying sd card in the upper left quadrant of the phone  simply place the microsd card face up with the metallic pins facing down and towards the right into the depressed slot area to the left of the sd card plaque  then slowly and gently slide the microsd card under the plaque until it clicks  if it isn t in correctly  it will tend to move back out from under the plaque  do not force  replace the back plate on the phone  turn the phone on   go to settings  storage   at the bottom of the page  you will see sd card   if the microsd card was inserted correctly  you will see the additional gbs of storage displayed there   you will also see reformat sd card and remove sd card   use these settings to erase data from the microsd card  and to remove it from the phone   do not try to remove the microsd card from the phone without first activating the remove sd card setting   you can damage the card and the phone   the card came quickly and san disk is a reliable brand  it s great to have the class    rating too \n",

      "initially when i inserted the card into the samsung galaxy s  it recognized it but it wasn t able to format it correctly  after doing some research i found a free program easeus partition master       that will format the card into fat    since windows no longer allows you to do it by default  after formatting it into fat    the phone recognized the card and it works great now  i hope this helps anyone else that might run into this problem \n",

      "i will keep it short and sweet for potential buyers looking for facts and not b s i own two of the   gb size of these cards for about   months now  they do work fairly well with cell phones and tablets  yet not so good with cameras  in fact these cards failed to work with my gopro hero  camera and the customer service rep from gopro claimed  and i happen to agree with him  that this card is not a true class    card let alone uhs   benchmarks with my evo  g with all allocation sizes the write speed never passed beyond  mb s while read speeds wondered around   mb s far below advertised speeds  well write speeds arent technically advertised  probably because they are of class   level benchmarks with crystal mark reported speeds even lower  due to adapter  with write speeds around  mb s while read speeds wondered around   mb s needless to say  if you are not worried about speeds and only about storage  these are perfect  if you want to use them for shooting high definition raw footage however  i suggest you not to loose your money on this  because even if your write speeds are around   mb s as the card begins to decay it will slow down to become useless again this review is based on gopro camera and high definition raw recording   for cell phones or for storage it works perfectly well with a bit of false advertisement  \n",

      "not as fast as advertised most of the time  actually slowed down my note   when i filled it with movies leaving only about  gb free  switched to a faster card due to that  but it could also be the phones fault  all in all it s a good card with good speed and size for the money \n",
      "product supplied as described    gb micro sdhc class    card with adapter  i purchased this to use in my samsung galaxy tablet and it works perfectly  it is easy to identify from other micro flash cards you may have because of its red grey color  this is a great memory solution for your stored media for any device \n",
      "product works as advertised  no issues with install or general use in my mobile phone  it doesn t seem particularly snappy  but that may be more the phone than anything else \n",

      "so i m not going to pretend to be an expert on sd cards  but i still like this one  it is relatively inexpensive  works wonderfully for the movies i want to store and watch on my samsung galaxy tab        and i haven t had a single problem with storage yet \n",
      "still working with no problems so far  so it seems to be reliable  not sure what else to say  but they want more words \n",
      "the card arrived promptly and has worked flawlessly in a dashcam  would recommend purchase to others if they need this kind of card \n",
      "the card looks good  works fine  i didn t do too much test with it my only complaint until now is the package  there s a line marked on the back for you to cut  i cut along the line  and nothing happened  no opening at all  all cardboard glued tightly  so i cut near the card  only to found i cut the supposed plastic card case storage shell  now i took it out  and no storage case to store  not a functional problem  but annoying \n",
      "the package arrived on time  it s very well packed and it s got an adapter  it works perfectly with my phone  though it doesn t allow a computer format  once it s been on the phone  so it asks you to erase everything before you use it on a computer  so if you re planning on buying this for different purposes and devices  gotta be aware of this  i just need for my phone  so i transfer files with my usb cable  that works just right  i also give it a   star because it says there are   gb  but even when it s totally formatted it only reaches to   gb  sooo  i don t know where my other   gb are   anyways  overall it s working well  i do think it s expensive for what it is \n",
      "there really isn t much to say about a micro sd card  it either works or it doesn t  i bought this to install in my phone and it seems to be working fine  the fit was perfect and the performance is totally satisfactory  i ve never had any trouble with sandisk products and this will likely be no exception  it was a great value compared to places i had priced locally \n",

      "this is a very fast microsd card compared to the class   speeds  it looks nice and it works  i m not sure what else i can say other than that i have no problems with it and it hasn t died on my yet it s been about   months at least now in my samsung galaxy s   the s  had a reputation for breaking sandisk sd cards for some reason and it s only randomly unmounted about   times but easily remounted with a take out and put back in with maybe a restart on the phone to refresh some apps to see it  i think this is just because the galaxy s  tends to get really hot right below the sd card which might damage it a bit  i don t think they put it in a good spot but that has nothing to do with the card itself so just get it if you want a nice sd card \n",
      "this is the best accessory that you can buy for your smartphone  simple explanation    i loaded all my hd movies onto this micro sd card  inserted it into my samsung galaxy s   and it plays them superbly without any delays  as it it up to   mb s read speed    the most important reason for this being the best accessory for your phone is to think about this  the premium you pay for an iphone   gb is       the price you pay for this   gb micro sd card is      depends on amazon s pricing at the time   that means you get the same thing for      less  and you can interchange your sd card between devices  if you buy a new tablet for example  no brainer note that it reads only at   mb s  so a  gb hd movie will take about         minutes to load up \n",

      "if your card gets hot enough to be painful  it is defective and you need to contact sandisk from my experience  the larger micro sds run hot on format and writing  but not to the pain threshold i purchased one of these cards to use in a camera and android tablet   great read speed but write speed was okay   used card for about two weeks and then all my files disappeared   tried to format the card and three different computers with xp  windows  and linux couldn t format it   the camera and tablet couldn t format it   i rma d it and got another because sandisk is a good brand   i did notice that when formatting or writing the card it got hot  very hot second card didn t last    hours and had the exact same symptoms as the first card   write a file or format it resulted in the card getting hot enough to reach the pain threshold   i called up sandisk and while explaining this was the second card i d received with the exact same symptoms  when i mentioned it getting hot  they immediately issued me an rma   they said they were told to issue an rma the moment they heard a card ran hot smaller sandisk micro sd s or regular sd s i have or use don t do this   i think sandisk has an issue with this card the last   digits of the part number refer to the date code and origin of the card   both cards had different date and origin codes \n",

      "works as specified  received in good condition from amazon  using since a few months  in a smartphone  it doesn t get better than this if you re using sandisk in terms of speed and space  you can expect speeds upto    mb sec for write  about   mb sec for read  with the provided adapter  speeds ar always better for both read write  using smartphone to read write  speeds would be lesser mostly  but average should be   mb sec anyways as per what i ve seen and i m a heavy user  like if there is a    gb microsdxc available  i would actually buy it  tried the extreme version with   mb sec  costs   times of this one  but works similar to this  so dont waste money on name that doesnt deliver  buy this if you re buying to sandisk\n",

      "than i expected  i don t know if it would kill any manufacturers to actually have a memory card or stick or device to actually have available the advertised capacity  fortunately l learned that the advertised and actual available memory are two separate things before i bought it  always scroll down and read the technical spec of a device or anything before you buy as that way ideally  your actually informed  let the buyer beware  is more appropriate every day as most things are not exactly as they seem  and if it s food and cheap  it s likely cancer causing and don t feed your body and your car in the same place \n",

      "i didn t see this brand listed on the gopro website as one of the recommended cards but i ve never had an issue with sandisk before so i gave it a try  it is a uhs  card so it doesn t ever stop recording due to write errors  for the price  you can t beat the quality that comes with it  it also included a microsd to standard sd card adapter so that you don t need a different card reader if you have one for your old sd cards \n",

      "to begin  i am not that knowledgeable in tech matters so when i received a new galaxy note   as a gift and decided to add storage i read some reviews on the sd cards and was reading about the compatibility of the    gb cards  exfat or fat  i guess the exfat was a successful diet   i was concerned somewhat but i ordered this one anyway and this is what my experience was  i added some music and videos onto the card using my apple macbook air with no problems and then inserted it into the note   with no problems and it immediately loaded everything with no problems  i have since taken it out and added some more music to it and it is working perfectly  i did not reformat or anything like that which was a great relief  although i have only used this item for a week now with issue which means something could go wrong in the future  i would give it more than   stars if possible because it was easy for someone like me  i know i used the phrase no problems multiple times but when you are my age and things go smoothly with no problems it is very good \n",

      "it s a micro sd hc  stores files  and is great at it i don t really know enough about these kinda things to go into details of how fast it is at transfering files but it worked great for copying video files from my computer  placing the same thing into my led tv  has a usb port  and watching the files from there   gb video files would play perfectly fine  perhaps that s saying enough about it  worth the money \n",
      "the product is ok  but my card does not acheive the rated write speed of    mb sec   most applications probably don t need to hit    mb sec  but my gopro hero   does need the full bandwidth and thus would bomb on me sometimes   as tested  my card got between      mb sec using the larger block sizes   i complained to sandisk about it and they allowed me to send it in for a replacement which i did  and took almost   weeks   but the replacement behaved the same way   i would say this card is ok for most applications  but if you need top end speed  i would go with another card   i bought my card in may      and had it replaced in august      so hopefully they have fixed this problem by now \n",
      "pay attention to your application and what class your card is   class   or unclassed may be cheaper but it may not give you the performance you want  don t be pennywise and poundfoolish    this was purchased to go into one of the newer mk    version tv streamer dongles and those take class     for the price this was a good value i have been using sandisk xd and sd regular and micro for   years now and always found them to be a consistent and high grade storage card  i can recommend this brand \n",

      "true to its name  sandisk is the best  i am only using this for my smartphone so i guess it s overkill  many said this type of micro sd card is meant for dslr s  i m going for quality and something that would last a long time  that s why i went for this  highly recommended \n",

      "big fan of sandisk and even more so as the price of flash decreases  can t compare to other brands as never has a reason to switch  minor price variations do not compel to do so and performance quality has never been in issue in many years of suing brand \n",

      "i have a dashcam   it didn t come with a memory card so i got this this card has been working well in a fairly demanding capacity   that s because like the way most drivers use dashcams  i ve got mine set to    minute loops   that means new data is being written over and over again on this card   so far the card hasn t quit on me and i m pleased \n",

      "this is very good memory for gopro  went with   gb because my brother  who has two gopro cameras  said he never filled up his    so why go for     anyway  this is versatile enough to go in phone or camera  i ordered two more \n",

      "from what i ve read  some galaxy users have had problems with microsd cards  but this one works great so far  lots of apps are willing to store their data on it  and samsung s built in camera is able to put its photos there instead of in the system memory  so it helps free up a lot of space for apps and things that have to be in the system memory  i ve put all my mp s on the card as well and they play back perfectly using both the samsung music app and google music \n",

      "i still own it but card went bad after   weeks of owning it  lost tons of music and data ect and lost all faith in sandisk products  i tried to get it replaced or money back but no return email from seller  so unhappy i lost over   gigs of movies music and data  wish there would have been a reply from seller or amazon but i still have a dead sdcard with all my files stuck on it \n",
      "i purchased two of these microsdxc cards when they were on sale around black friday  and have been using them now for just about two months  they work wonderfully and i have had absolutely no problems with either  these sandisk memory cards are    gb microsdxc class     uhs   cards  which are rated for transfer speeds up to   mb sec the uhs class   designation is intended as an performance measure that indicates the card is capable of supporting real time full hd video recording  of course  this only works if you are using a device which is capable of writing to the card at those speeds  but most modern devices that offer full hd recording  such as camcorders  digital slr cameras  and cell phones with built in full hd recording do support this standard  the benefit of using a uhs   card on a uhs certified device is that you should not encounter the problem of buffering or your device stopping recording because it could not write fast enough however  because these are extra high capacity  sdxc cards  you will need to make sure that your device can support microsdxc cards  and not simply microsd or microsdhc ones  the biggest difference is that the microsdxc standard uses the exfat file system  rather than the fat   or ntfs systems  while most modern android devices  and in fact most linux unix devices  can handle that without difficulty some devices  such as older cameras  android devices  and some windows devices  may have difficulty with the format having said that  i ve been using these in nikon d     d     digital slr cameras  as well as samsung galaxy s  and galaxy s relay  g phones without any difficulty  and they read   write fine on my computers  all in all these were a great buy and i m very happy with them \n",

      "i bought this card because my   gb sandisk ultra stopped working in my galaxy s    i tried formatting the card  but it didn t work   when this card showed up  i read the warranty information  and the ultra series has a lifetime warranty  i emailed the company  and they sent me a shipping label to return the card  and my new on is on the way   i highly recommend these cards \n",

      "i have this card in my samsung galaxy iii it has been in there now for about   months with no issues okay  it had one issue but that was the phone design itself  it would un mount if the phone was moved around roughly  it seems to pop out very easy in the samsung galaxy phones  so i solved the problem by putting some electrical tape on it to hold it in  so far after   months it hasn t un mounted it will give you an ungodly amount of storage on this phone  if your wondering if your samsung phone will take this card   it will with no issues  it shows a total of      gb of available space once installed  a must have since most phones come with   gb of internal memory nowadays \n",

      "doesn t work in my s  skyrocket but works in my xoom  odd but i have to suffer with it  seems about the same as my class    will not get sandisk again unless its tons cheaper    was stolen by some tweakers which sucks\n",
      "bought both this and a similar transcend premium    x    gb microsdhc class    uhs for a couple of g wh dash cams   both work well with the cameras   the key is you need cards compliant with uhs   or better   look for the u with a   or a   inside it on the card for these cameras   the transcend is rated slightly faster but the cameras seem to like either equally well   when i purchased this transcend and the sandisk were within pennies of each other  so aside from slight price and speed differences  there s not much to recommend one over the other   and so long as you get at least a uhs   card  the same can be said for other manufacturers such as g skill  kingston  or others \n",

      "i bought this card because i have several devices that use microsd cards  but not all of them are compatible with the newer and higher capacity sdxc standard  for sdhc memory cards    gb is the largest size available under that technology standard  so i went with this one from sandisk  that way i didn t have to worry about compatibility issues with any of my devices  i ve used sandisk memory products for a number of years along with many other brands  and i ve always had good results from them  i m happy to say that my experience with this card echoes that of        other amazon users  it s been rock steady  reliable with larger file transfers  several  gb  movies at a time   and performed as quickly as i d hoped for a class    card in regards to its read write times aside from the existing reviews and my previous experiences with sandisk products  i also picked up this particular card due to its uhs   compliance  i don t currently have any uhs   devices that can take advantage of the increased speed  but for the negligible cost difference  it just made sense  standards and technology update so fast these days  any future proofing a product can provide to extend its usable life is always appreciated \n",
      "works perfectly in my     samsung  phone is only usb   so i don t know if you really need such a fast mem chip  can get a lot of stuff into    gb  i use for movies for when i am on the train and don t want to waste my data streaming from the cloud \n",

      "this is called      class          so i ordered it  figuring it would have useable speed  i plugged it in to copy about  gb of program installation files  i was totally dumbfounded that it took about   hours to copy those files onto this      ultra           class         sdxc card    gb on my super slow  super cheap plastic school kid usb thumb drive takes less than    minutes   so then i tested it on various known computers with typical raw and jpg picture files  read speeds ranged from      mb s  while write speeds ranged from    mb sec for big files  and below  mb sec for small files  this is what i would call largely unusable  very disappointing \n",

      "this card no longer is readable by three different phones after only six months of very light usage  very few pictures had been saved to the card   where it was never taken in or out of the phone before it showed signs of dying  thus the death was not caused by excessive handling of the card  \n",

      "i was out of space on my droid razr   gb and still had an empty microsd slot  so i figured i d pick this up seeing as how it is a reputable brand in flash memory  i am glad i went with the sandisk ultra  because there is seemingly no difference in speed between this drive and the built in internal memory of my phone  i record a lot of videos with my phone and i ve been recording straight to this card in hd with no problems at all installation was a breeze  i took the memory card out of the package and inserted into my phone  then my phone brought up a menu asking if i wanted to move my music  videos  and photos to the memory card  i selected all three categories  and in minutes it had moved all of my media onto the memory card  i didn t even have to do anything else  i had read some other reviews that said they had to reformat the card or mess around with moving files by hand  but i didn t have to do any of that i haven t tried using the included sd adapter yet  but i imagine it will work as well as any other adapter  the adapter and memory card were both shipped in a little clear plastic case  which makes it easier to carry the adapter around with you  so you have it with you when you need it the price on this card when i bought it was a few dollars more than the generic brands  i decided to spend a few extra dollars on it since i would be really upset if i lost all my photos and videos due to a corrupt memory card  i am very satisfied with the product and i would highly recommend it to anyone looking to increase the storage capacity of their phone or anything else this would fit in \n",

      "not much to say about this other than it works fine   the included adapter was difficult to remove the microsdhc card from  but that may be due to my big fingers  plus the card is very small as one would expect from micro naming    the speed is more than adequate with no buffering issues noticed from video capture on a phone at hd      resolution   recommended \n",

      "   update               so my lovely wife bought me a samsung galaxy tab   for father s day and i ve been loving it ever since   just as other with samsung products  the galaxy tab   has the ability to add a microsd card to expand the memory on the device   since it s been over a year  i decided to do some more research to see if sandisk offered anything new   as of            their product lineup for microsd cards from worst to best  performance wise  are the as follows sandisksandisk ultrasandisk ultra plussandisk extremesandisk extreme plussandisk extreme pronow  the difference between all of these cards are simply the speed in which you can read write data to the card   yes  the published rating of most all these cards  except the sandisk regular  are class    uhs i but that s just a rating    actual real world performance does get better with each model  but with faster cards come more expensive prices   since amazon doesn t carry the ultra plus model of microsd card  i had to do direct comparisons between the sandisk ultra           extreme           and extreme plus          as mentioned in my earlier review  i purchased the sandisk ultra for my galaxy s    my question was  did i want to pay over     more for a card that is faster than the one i already owned   or i could pay almost double to get sandisk s  nd most fastest microsd card the ultra works perfectly fine for my style of usage  storing capturing pictures   hd video and movie playback  on my phone   so in the end  i ended up just buying another sandisk ultra   gb card   i use my cell phone  more  than i do my tablet and if the card is good enough for my phone  it s good enough for my tablet   i don t own a  k hd camera or anything like that  so i honestly didn t see a need to get one of the faster cards at this time i am now a proud owner of   sandisk ultra cards and have absolutely   issues with it in my samsung devices    original review              i haven t had to buy a microsd card in a long time  the last time i bought one was for my cell phone over   years ago  but since my cellular contract was up  i knew i would have to get a newer card in addition to my new phone  the samsung galaxy s   reason for this is because i knew my small   gb microsd card wasn t going to cut it doing research on the galaxy s   i wanted to get the best card possible that had decent capacity     gb or greater   this led me to find that the galaxy s  supports the microsdxc class    uhs i card  which is the fastest possible given that class  searching for that specifically on amazon gave me results of only   vendors  as of april  that makes these microsdxc class    uhs   cards  they are sandisk  the majority   samsung and lexar  nobody else makes these that are sold on amazon seeing how sandisk is a pretty good name out of the    i ve used them the most   i decided upon the sandisk because lexar was overpriced and the samsung one was overpriced  as well as not eligible for amazon prime  but the scary thing is that when you filter by the sandisk  you literally get dozens of options  all of them have different model numbers  different sizes  etc  then there s that confusion of what s the difference between sdhc   sdxc sdhc vs sdxc sdhc stand for  secure digital high capacity  and sdxc stands for  secure digital extended capacity   essentially these two cards are the same with the exception that sdhc only supports capcities up to   gb and is formated with the fat   file system  the sdxc cards are formatted with the exfat file system  if you use an sdxc card in a device  it must support that file system  otherwise it may not be recognizable and or you have to reformat the card to fat   fat   vs exfat the differences between the two file systems means that fat   has a maximum file size of  gb  limited by that file system  exfat on the otherhand  supports file sizes up to  tb  terabytes   the only thing you need to know here really is that it s possible your device doesn t support exfat  if that s the case  just reformat it to fat    remember formatting erases all data to clarify the model numbers  i i hopped over to the sandisk official webpage  what i found there is that they offer two  highspeed  options for sandisk cards  these are sandisk extreme pro and sandisk ultra  sandisk extreme pro is a line that supports read speeds up to   mb sec  however they are sdhc only  to make things worse  they are currently only available in   gb    gb capacities  since one of my requirements was to have a lot of storage  i ruled these out the remaining devices listed on amazon s search were the sandisk ultra line  but here  confusion sets in because sandisk separates these cards to two different devices  cameras   mobile devices  is there a real difference between the two or is this just a marketing stunt  unfortunately i m not sure but i do know the price difference between the two range from a couple cents to a few dollars  since i wasn t sure  i opted for the one specifically targeted for mobile devices  just in case there is some kind of compatibility issue   to find the exact model number  i would go to sandisk s webpage  sandisk com  and compare their existing product lineup  from there  you get exact model numbers and you can then search amazon for these model numbers  that is how i got mine  sdsdqua    g  as for speed tests  i haven t run any specific testing  but copying   gb worth of data from my pc to the card literally took just a few minutes one last note is that amazon attaches additional characters to the end  for example sdsdqua    g affp a vs sdsdqua    g u  a   the difference between the two is that the  affp a  means  amazon frustration free packaging   other than that  these are exactly the same   if you re wondering what i got  and want to use it in your galaxy s    i got the sdsdqua    g u  a and it works like charm \n",
      "i inserted this little gem in to my new nook hd and let me tell you    wow   she loves it so much and she won t give it back   instead of buying larger capacity tablets    just buy the smallest amount of gigs and buy one of these little dudes \n",

      "a standard when it comes to high capacity mobile memory   grated  if you have an older android phone  or older tablet  you probably won t see much difference   but if you have a modern device like a galaxy s   or note    or equivalent mobile device  you ll definitely notice the difference in data transfer and access in your device   for modern phones  a uhs   memory card is a must   the only reason i didn t give this product five stars is because it s not a sandisk extreme  or a sandisk extreme pro   but then again  you must have extremely specific needs to want to get   mb s transfer speeds on a mobile device   for movies  music and apps  this one is more that adequate \n",

      "picked this up for my sport action camera and it s just what i needed  class    and the speeds match up with the rating  came with a sd card adapter which was a nice bonus  been using it for almost   months now with formatting after each filming  no lag on any of the video  no problems with card  running strong \n",
      "i couldn t put any files onto the card that were        gb  a little disappointing since i wanted to store movies on it  but i guess it s a limitation of the microsd hc technology \n",

      "ok  this won t be a technical review or a rating of measured speeds  it is simply a review from a consumer point of view  i have bought a couple of these microsdxc memory cards for tablets  and have seen no lag in saving data  i also use them for digital cameras  and have been very happy with the record time   it s instant  you can get into the mb s on various cards  but usually  the difference is not something that anyone would notice or see  for the price  this is an excellent memory card  and i would highly recommend it \n",
      "i was using mine in a gopro hero     the card just broke for no reason   there is controversy weather its the gopro or sandisk  but after doing some google research it seems that its more of sandisk s fault as these sd cards also fail  or used to  in varies samsung devices  phones   tablets    amazon sent me a replacement  so no harm done  but for the money you would expect something top notch gopro users  on the support forums  recommend getting  x  gb sd cards  which have not had any issues as far as anyone knows   the worst part is losing important content  i was lucky  i copied my movies from the sd card onto a hd on my pc   others not so lucky \n",
      "does as it is supposed to \n",
      "everything is working as expected the product is very good  the speed transfer is ok i use it with my xperia smartphone\n",
      "this is the second time i have purched this sandisk card  i have one in my note   and now one in my new galaxy note pro       i really wanted the    gb for my pro but the price was too high for me to justify spending around      when this one is currently around      i hope the price drops soon on the    gb  this was simple to install and didn t require formatting on either device  just plug and save  it was that easy \n",
      "works great and price was not too bad either  worked perfect with out having to format it  transfer rate was fast when i loaded    movies and   gb of musice and   gb of pictures all at the same time  it took a total of    min  probably because i had multiple transfers at same time but works great for my new bought samsung galaxy note       thanks\n",

      "memory is typically a go no go kind of deal   speeds can also be a factor but in reality i have nothing to really challenge the speed claims of this memory so that is a moot point \n",
      "i purchased this for my gopro hero   and it worked ok for a while  then suddenly the camera would only record about    seconds at a time   after reading some forums online  i was prompted to swap this sandisk out for a samsung card   all of my problems went away   i still use this card for random storage  but i won t use it in a camera again \n",
      "does a good job at a nice price  i like this  it came on time and fits well in my dell venue pro\n",
      "with this card i picked up for     amazon s black friday sale  i increased my gnii s storage to   gb  it transfers data at about   mb read write  which is well below advertised  however  this is very similar to the speed that my gnii s built in storage transfers data at  so when running large applications off of this sd card i see no difference in speed than running apps off of the phone itself \n",
      "nothing interesting to write  it works just fine and holds a lot of info for such a little card  thanks \n",
      "i have been using this card for about a month now  in my contour roam   camera  and it has performed flawlessly  i have not had any issues  and have deleted and re used several times  so far  so good \n",

      "i had been using a  regular  sandisk   gb micro sd card that came included with my htc thunderbolt i bought in       the size was decent  but i never realized until upgrading how much i was lacking on the speed i finally got one of these to replace my old card with my galaxy s   it is superb  i just recently got a galaxy s   and again  this card is just about the best expansion you can add to most any phone with my old microsd card  i had gotten used to just sitting there  zoning out  as i waited patiently for my computer to transfer pictures videos off my card to be backed up to my pc s hard drive  or copying some music files from my pc to my card  with this new card  almost any single file  even hundreds of megabytes big  is an instant transfer  that transfers too quick to even bring up that      moving      dialog box in windows    on my very big transfers  lots of hd video files at once  totaling several gigabytes   i have to wait  but i m waiting for seconds instead of minutes combine the excellent speed with the fact that   gb can hold a ton of data  compared to typical storage sizes on phones   and you have a very satisfied customer  now i can procrastinate even longer the occasional transfers of all my pictures and videos to my pc  though i try not to a lot of phones  like my s   specify   gb sdxc cards as the maximum they support  so this is about the best you can even get for the moment  unless you want to pay almost double for sandisk s extreme cards  unless you have money to burn  i think these are a much better value and diminishing returns certainly kick in beyond this price point  but perhaps my next phone will support  k hd video onto    gb cards and i will yet again need to upgrade my card s capacity and speed    anyway  bottom line on this product  awesome \n",
      "bought this a few months back for my phone    but after switching phones to one that didn t support extra storage i reformatted and stuck it on my car stereo full of music  even at full capacity it has been there for months now playing without a hitch  music only take about   seconds after starting the car to start playing  skipping  fast forwarding or searching all works flawlessly  the stereo is to be given some props here but if the card wasn t up to par it clearly wouldn t be as fast as it is  very glad with the purchase  will buy again if the need ever comes \n",
      "with technology improving upon solid state memory extremely quickly  there s no excuse to buy the best in speed  without sacrificing quality many   gb cards are class      which makes them very slow  if you re going to be utilizing   gb of data for photos videos  your phone or just super small storage  you re much better off purchasing a faster card such as this  the price is right  and even if it s a little more expensive than the class     or even   s  you will regret having pinched a few dollars instead of investing into faster speeds i currently use this in my sony action cam  and the write speed works perfectly for me  as well as the reading speed to transfer files off the card \n",
      "i used this to turn my nook color into an android   it was incredibly easy to install and works great   i haven t had any problems with it   the read and write speeds are phenomenal  given that i am running an entire operating system off just this card   the price was great too \n",

      "i have come to trust the sandisk brand for file storage and was not disappointed with this card   it has held up to months of constant file writing and re writing with use in a dash cam that loop records   i recommend this card to anyone \n",
      "i ended up with two of these after mistakenly purchasing the regular sized sd cards for hikvision security cameras only to find that they needed the micro sd cards instead   they installed and formatted with no issues and are working well in the cameras the best thing about sandisk is that they have a lifetime warranty with these cards unlike some of the other brands i purchased these for    dollars each and are reasonably priced around that \n",
      "i bought this class    sd card for my gopro   black and it works great  i only recorded with     p   fps with protunes and never had any problems  in the past in my gopro hero  it was very picky with the sd card that you use  but so far this card works great  i do not trust the transfer speed test because there are so many factors that change the outcome  card reader  usb version  hard drives  and etc  \n",
      "i use this in my dell venue   tablet  i have loaded it up with movies  mp   s  and they playback flawlessly  however if it try to add a very large movie   gb   my windows   machine says that it is too large for the destination format  i shrink them down when that happens  again  i am very happy with this purchase  just wanted to point out a small limitation \n",
      "it s inside of my galaxy s   and has worked great  it greatly helps expand the    gig internal memory  so i can store music and videos better \n",
      "does what it suppose to do    works great works well  good price  would buy another  good storage for any digital file \n",
      "good product  it arrived extremely fast and performs just as described  it was considerably cheaper than any other store i found  i specially like the speed of this sd card  however do keep in mind that the speeds tend to be exaggerated  the speeds are way faster than normal sd card speeds and you will notice it  but not anywhere close to whats advertised  there a lot of factor that go in to consideration when it comes to the advertised speed  this is not the manufacture or seller fault  but it depends on the system that is being used \n",
      "got two of these   one for our samsung galaxy note      tablet and one for my samsung galaxy note ii cell phone   both devices had no problem recognizing the new   gb cards   couldn t be any easier to use   nice to have a large amount of storage on both devices   the easy to open packaging was a real treat   i did not use the adapters as i just connect my phone and tablet to my laptop via usb to transfer music  photos and music \n",

      "something this small with so much information stored on it freaks me out  but i ve had zero problems with it over the past year  the only issue i had is that the adapter that came with it did not work  the microsd card went into it kind of sidways like it was made wrong  luckily i had another adapter lying around  and the sd card itself works perfectly and i ve had no issues with data loss or corruption \n",

      "this is a great addition to a tablet  i store and watch movies on it as well as music and pictures  it does everything it says it does in its description and i have had it for about a year with no issues at all  i cant really think of anything bad to mention at all except that its so much memory in much a small package it could be the easiest way to loose nearly     movies in a washing machine and not even notice \n",

      "i bought this for my lg optimus g pro  to hold my    gb music collection   it works great   it took a while to transfer all my music  but that can be expected   once i popped this into the phone and started us the music player  it found a cataloged all my music   i don t like the latest default android music player  but that s another story  and there are other music players you can download  \n",

      "this card only lasted two weeks before it began giving read errors  i used it in a dash cam and no matter how many times i formatted  it would only record for about a minute before failing again  i picked up a pny card since and it has worked beautifully  unfortunately  i ve been swamped and forgot to return this card before my    days  not happy about that \n",
      "i bought this with the sole intention of putting it in my samsung galaxy s   i had to use a tool to format the card to fat    but once i did so  the card worked great  i have been taking advantage of the extra room i have for music  videos  pictures  etc  the sd adapter that comes with this is also handy the transfer speeds didn t feel like class    when connected and transferred files from my computer  but my computer is   years old  so it s very possible that it s the problem  other than that  i m completely satisfied \n",
      "a lot of the other class    micro sd cards that came out seemed to have issues after a year of usage   this one works great in my galaxy s    i also like the color on the card  so much better than just black  so stylish   except it s hiding inside the back of my phone   maybe i should make a clear window just where the micro sd card is   so everyone knows i am using the sandisk ultra class     hmm\n",

      "i tested it in several uhs   compliant devices and found the write speed at       mbyte second  sounds fine for a class    card but this is not what i was paying for  i don t expect it to run anywhere close to uhs   interface speed      mb s  but it should be close to    mb s as the manufacturer advertised  i have a lot more choices if i am only looking for a class    card indeed  microsd cards are usually slower than full size sd card  they use the same flash controller so the reason is really microsd cards use slower nand flash  manufacturers know you are not going to use microsd cards in high speed slrs so they get to sell you lower quality nand at a premium  my advice to you the photography enthusiasts is to buy full size sd cards rather than microsd cards with adaptors that said  the compatibility is great  it works great with my tablets  pcs  gpss and phones  that is what i like about sandisk  they do thorough compatibility tests before product release \n",

      "i purchased the card in the sandisk packaging  so i am pretty sure it is genuine  i tested it with various programs on the web that apparently can detect whether they are fakes or not  this one turned out to be a real sandisk card  the card came formatted with fat   i read on the web about these micro sds  and apparently they are not as fast as the full sd card version  i borrowed my brothers sandisk   gb full sd card to make comparison tests  here are my official unofficial test results using diskbench v        and h testw     test  i will give the results as an  overall  result  because after testing these cards over and over with speed writes and reads  the results get mixed and varied to a big degree    much larger than i expected  but the numerous tests showed me a  general  trend  the trend is that the full sd cards do write faster than the microsd card  but  also remember that the microsd had to be put into an adapter to do the test on my pc while the fullsd card was put into the computer reader directly these are just my averages  but small file writes both sd cards wrote at close to   mb sec  the microsd was less consistent in the tests and sometimes dropped to  mb sec small file reads both sd cards read at close to    mb sec at their fastest large file copies to card microsd wrote at    mb sec while the fullsd wrote at about  mb seclarge file reads copies from card microsd was   mb sec while the fullsd read at about   mb sec my conclusion my tests were by no means official for this card and showed much variance dependent on file size of the reads and writes  but the fullsd card was faster in many cases  but equal to microsd in most cases  the small file writes and reads showed that they are similar enough  but  my only concern is with large file writes     is     mb sec good enough for rapid photography on a high pixel camera  i don t know  i have had no problem using these cards with h    movie capture for hours  i am surprised that     mb sec is enough also  never during the huge file copies to the card did i get any noticeable heating of the card itself  by touch even for an hour  i ve noticed that it has been a complaint from many people on the web  some stating that they felt they might burn themselves  i copied files that took more than an hour with no noticeable temperature change  other than  perhaps a couple of degrees  of course  this was on a pc and not installed in a camera the card performs well for video work  and appears to meet many other tests performed by other people  i never saw a read close to    mb sec    they were very consistent at    mb sec at the highest performance i would get the card again  if the price were right \n",

      "i got my wife a samsung galaxy tab        for christmas  and it took awhile for her to start figuring out all the things it can do   once she did  that led  of course  to her wanting to watch movies on it   that was my signal to spring into action  that is  if i wanted to prevent her from running wild  buying  digital copies  of every movie we already have in dvd or blu ray   you can t play dvd or blu ray movies on this device  but you can use your computer s dvd or blu ray drive and commonplace third party software to convert movies in this format into   mp   and or several other types of video files that can be played on this tablet since this particular tablet is capable of playing high definition video  screen resolution is      x     pixels   and we want to use all of that high def capability  my conversion files tend to be pretty large  average   to   gb per movie      way too big to be stored on the tablet s limited internal memory   that s where the tablet s microsd slot     and this sandisk flash memory     comes in   i make huge mp  s  store them separately on a     terabyte drive  and then load as many of them as i can on this chip  which shows up in the tablet as a separate memory source   then all you have to do is pull up one of the movie files from the card  and hit play   you can use the device s standard video player  or get an app with more controls watching high def video on a tablet that s streaming the data from a memory card  rather than the tablet s internal memory  requires a memory card with very high  read speed   and this sandisk card s  class     rating fills that bill   that s the difference between cheaper microsd that s primarily designed for simple data storage  and microsd that s designed for higher active transfer read speeds   the  class     designation generally means that the subject card will transfer data at a minimum rate of   mb per second   this sandisk  ultra  card is capable of transferring data at speeds of up to   mb per second  depending on the speed of the device you re using it in  and other particulars of the way you re using the device  frustration free packaging  means the chip  sd adapter  and plastic case comes in a little  sealed cardboard envelope with a pull tab opener   this card comes pre formatted for android  and my use of it in the galaxy tab   for watching high def  mp  movies has thus far been flawless finally  don t let yourself get burned by counterfeiters in trying to save a buck   while pricing on memory tends to fluctuate  amazon s current pricing on this card is very competitive with any all vendors out there selling genuine sandisk  ultra  memory   buy from amazon  or other trustworthy vendor  because i just learned the hard way that these memory cards are being counterfeited in huge numbers     that is  the counterfeiters are placing sandisk labeling packaging on inferior  generic microsd  and selling the bogus chips on ebay and anywhere else they can   i bought three from amazon after i got burned by a chinese seller on ebay   the counterfeit packaging and labeling was good enough to fool me  until i actually tried one of the chips in the galaxy tab       the write speed  that is  the amount of time it takes to transfer files onto the microsd card  was dramatically worse than the speed of a genuine sandisk  ultra  card  and the read speed was totally inadequate for playing movies on the galaxy tab     i may never have figured it out at all if i didn t already have one other  genuine sandisk  ultra  with which to compare the fakes if you want the best  most reliable memory for the microsd slot on your shiny  new android device  look no further     this is it \n",

      "i m glad these are red and grey and not all black to be honest   after dropping a black one in the grass the other night   spent    minutes searching a   sq foot area   seriously they need to not ever make removable storage smaller than these things other than that  it works great  no problems whatsoever   if you need to reformat  it s suggested you use the sd formatting tool from the sd association  of which sandisk is a permanent member   windows doesn t exactly follow the specification  though for most uses windows format will work too here s the funny part   this is about    more than the   gb sandisk class   card   i ve been waiting for those cards to drop in price as faster speeds take over   but they don t drop in price   and thanks to the newegg free shipping on items over      it s actually cheaper overall when you order the     class    card and get free shipping instead of the     class   card plus       shipping \n",

      "my review is a little backwards        but i thought the most relevant should go first warning  only buy this card on sale the  typical  price since summer      is about     for    gb  and about     for    gb   do not pay any more than this  and you can actually pay less if you have the luxury of time   patience the lowest  non lightning  price hit about        for   gb and     for   gb  in early december   i basically buy when the price hits     or less  and the    nears        from december      to january       i watched these cards change price on an almost daily basis   they initially went on sale for about        and        for    and    respectively   i watched them slowly increase in price  with random dips and peaks for a month   on january  th       they still show as a      best deal on amazon      for        more days      but they are at the highest price point since last summer    and higher than i have  ever  payed for these cards   so don t let the      best deals      section deceive you  at          these are not a      deal      in terms of price okay  here s my actual      review      of these absolutely great sdxc cards     i have tried a variety of microsdxc cards  and so far the samsung ultra uhs  are the best    and the price can t be beat    for all the most important reasons  speed  capacity  reliability  durability i have not had a single failure  and i use these cards in my nook hd   nexus         via usb  and my canon  d mark ii  with converter  and macbook pro  in the card slot    they re durable and waterproof  and  i can use the same card in all these devices without reformatting   i even had one go through the wash  and i still use it for pictures for the technically inclined  i have cards with  both  the clockwork mod bootloader  for the nook hd   and the magiclantern firmware for my canon eos  d ii on the same card   i can pull it from the nook  shoot pictures with the camera  and look at the results on the nook by just pulling the card out of one device and placing it in the other   this should be possible with any sdxc sdhc card  but it turns out that the samsung uhs  is the only card i ve found that works reliably   some cards won t boot because they re too slow too finicky  but all my samsung uhs s work great  the   gb will not boot in the nook  but no   gb card will  i keep my eyes open for price drops on these cards because they ve performed so well for me   samsung also has a newer  faster card  but its price point hovers somewhere north of      prohibitive      so i still stick with these   and that s good news regardless because as the new card increases its market share  these should drop even further in price \n",
      "maybe i got a defective card but this one felt a bit      thinner      and      flimsier      than other micro sd cards i ve had the real problem was after a week of use as expanded storage in a tablet  i started having trouble with certain programs installed on the card  then finally the tablet gave me a message that the card was corrupt  and while a pc would recognize it  eery time i tried to format the card  there would be an error \n",

      "i bought this a little under a year ago to use with my laptop  worked just as advertised for much of that time until it stopped letting me write or delete stuff from it  could read just fine   i couldn t even format it  so it kinda just sat there for a while  after trying to format it a number of different ways  i finally contacted sandisk  and they said they will send me a replacement free of charge  i would have maybe given this a lower rating  but the customer service from sandisk made up for the faulty card  i am just glad it fell under a warranty period  i think   had the card not failed  i would have given five stars  if sandisk wouldn t replace it  would have given one star  hopefully the latter doesn t happen to you\n",

      "there is a known issue with a batch of these cards where they can completely die   this is known defect  affecting a lot of galaxy s  and note users   so if your card dies  either exchange through amazon or contact sandisk for a replacement   newer cards are supposedly fixed  but you might want to back up your data just in case   mine were purchased in november      and both have now failed in separate phones  unreadable by pcs or phones \n",

      "got it on sale for an incredible price   the only way i am likely to upgrade from this is if they come out with a    g size     g is not necessary for my use  but at     i would be able to use it without worry of running out of space  and  put my entire mp  catalog on it as well update   about   months after i bought this and installed it in my galaxy s   it started causing some trouble for my phone   at first i did not realize it was the micro sd card causing the problem  but it would occasionally have a status message saying something like  unmount the sd card before removing it to avoid corrupting your data   and eventually it didn t even recognize that there was a card in there at all   i put the old  gb card back in and it works fine   put the   gb card into the adapter  and put it into the computer s card reader    nothing   wouldn t read it at all i do back up my phone occasionally  maybe once a month  but lost everything  every photo and video i had taken of my new kitten since i got her because of this   it is very surprising since sandisk is usually quite reliable   my wife has the same card in her phone  we got them around the same time  and hers is still working normally so far ymmv  but always back up your data regularly  more than once a month  if you are taking a lot of pictures and video \n",

      "the primary reason for buying this extra capacitysandisk ultra    gb microsdxc class   card was to use it insamsung galaxy tab         inch model gt p     and i am happy to share that you can get this to work flawlessly after some initial glitches   read below firstly you need to be aware that the samsung tablet model gt p     currently runs with android os       with kernel               and build number jro  c p    ueclk   jelly bean  my experiences shared here are with that level of android os your experiences may vary depending on what version of os you are running  the sandisk ultra    gb microsdxc card purchased from amazon  retail packaging  gets recognized just fine however when the tablet s media device a k a  mtp  application attempts to talk your pc via usb cable the tablet simply reboots  and after that the card is presented to the pc    really strange indeed this baffled me for couple of hours  firstly  i attempted to format the card  exfat  in pc and it formatted just fine  after that i attempted to use it in the tablet to see the same behavioral oddity of instantaneous reboot of the tablet as  mtp  application tries to communicate with the pc  this made me investigate the issue further and i determined the root cause was the fact that sandisk now seen to factory format the card with  exfat  but also somehow seen to include an  offset  of   mb at the beginning of the card which shows up as   mb unallocated region in the initial sectors on this card under windows disk management tool the solution is to get rid of that  unallocated    mb partition on the card  you could do it in pc but that might require some windows command line experience and using  diskpart  utility and what not and i do not want to confuse people here with that process  for most novice users the process should be very simple  just insert the card on the tablet and use the  native  sd card format tool under  settings  that android os       has and it will get rid of that   mb partition and happily remount it  now after this simple process the  mtp  application works just fine with pc to transfer files to the sd card without any strange reboot phenomenon not sure why sandisk formats their class    card in this fashion  they never did it with their class   cards earlier  and there s gotta be some technical explanation for why they include that   mb partition that only sandisk can give  in the end if you reformat the card in the tablet  which defaults to exfat  the card is seen to work just fine bottomline            this is an awesome   gb capacity microsd card from a reputed manufacturer for budget minded people and gets the job done beautifully  the read and write speeds are adequate enough for most audio video   picture file formats in a tablet  the glitch mentioned above forced me to give  four  stars instead of  five  stars but let that not stop you from making a decision to buy it highly recommended cheers \n",
      "i purchased this because my samsumg galaxy s  was getting full of pictures  it installed easy  works great and i have had no speed issues when writing or reading from it \n",
      "i ve had this memory card in my s  for the past few months without any issues  the only problem i ve had with this was when i initially copied the   gb of data from my old card to this card  i had this connected to my laptop using a microsd usb adapter and the copies kept failing  i figured out that the card was overheating when writing a lot of data  i was able to copy the data by pointing a small desk fan towards the card adapter during the file copy process  that being said  i don t have any read write problems due to overheating with the card installed in my phone  i ve copied over a couple of gigs of movies to watch on some trips with the card installed in the phone without any failures  it may be that heat issue only occurs after pushing       gb of data at a time  the largest movie i copied to the phone was  gb  most of the other movies are just over a gig the only prep work for use in my phone was the initial format when it was first installed  the card was recognized prior to the formatting but i had seen where others had read write issues so the format was a preemptive move \n",
      "i don t have too much to say about an sd card  but i wanted to at least give it the   stars it deserves  we used it in a galaxy s  and it has worked flawlessly so far  i haven t  run any benchmarks to confirm the speed  etc but it does not seem to hinder the phone or camera  which we now have saving photos videos to the sd card  in any way i will point out the the s  camera app did notify us that burst mode shots will still write to the phone s internal memory  potentially due to the high date of data being written  that s good to know if you use burst mode a lot and were hoping to use an sd card for that purpose \n",
      "came quick and works well with my galaxy s   formating was simple  its a sandisk not much that could be wrong with it \n",
      "full disclosure  i use no other brand of sd card other than sandiskhaving said that  i was pleased to discover an sd card designed for people who demand fast transfer speeds for hd video applications  i purchased this item for my tablet pc and have been pleased with its functionality  the adapter is great for accessing via computer to transfer files directly if usb is not desired \n",
      "it s been working for over   years on my gp camera   has not crashed nor failed me   i ve shot over a hundred hours of footage on this card   i will buy again for sure \n",
      "performs as expected  i bought for mi galaxy s  to increase it storage options  when i need to transfer big files i use a usb adapter since the wifi and mtp conectios speed is far slower than directly connecting the device but that is not the cards problem  its fast reading and writing inside the s  and when connected to a current generation computer old computers will read and write at slower speeds  but is still compatible hardware wise  the exfat format can be a hassle no problems yet hardware wise  i would have preferred an open standard as partition format instead of exfat  but that is microsoft fault not sandisk is easy to reformat with a usb sd micro sd adapter \n",
      "works well with my dslr  have never been able to fill it  i guess   gb would be enough for average use  go for faster speeds and smaller size \n",
      "use it  with the included adapter  as a spare card for my panasonic fz    lumix camera and as a quick and easy temporary backup drive for my macbook pro laptop  which has a standard sd slot   also use it to make a quick transfer of files between the laptop and an imac  works exactly like a full size sd card for these purposes  very fast and reliable data transfers  and the special price from amazon made these cards less costly than the standard    gb card at the time update  i have changed the star rating from a   to a    this micro card worked fine for about three months and then suddenly began to disappear from the laptop finder  it still shows up and works fine when mounted in the desktop imac  but often it will not mount in the laptop  this could be a problem with the laptop and if that turns out to be the case  i will restore this to a   star rating \n",

      "first off  i ve always bought sandisk for the warranty under the reasoning that a lifetime warranty means they must be a little better than the others and sandisk s lesser lines  i have   class   sd  gb extreme iii series cards all pushing   years old now with zero problems  all of which write nearly twice as fast  not sure what the limitation is  class    uhs    and   year newer tech should blow these away   the  micro  packaging shouldn t make a difference either   i can only guess it s marketing differentiation again this card will write at published specs but you may want to check out the sony sr  uya tqmn of the same capacity  it reads and writes faster and is a similar price  though only a one year warranty  i picked it up with a hisense   pro tablet  awesome  and couldn t wait  and they were on sale locally for      was a pleasant surprise  came with a sd adapter as well and some file recovery software  a link    not a fan of sony web sites support or or documentation for any of their gear the last    years but these are commodities now i suppose and you can t expect much any longer  i now kind of think if these things work    days  they ll probably work      years until they are obsolete  fyi the sandisk and sony are both made in china \n",

      "the card does all it promises to do  but i have a gripe  the nail ridge near the outer end of the card is not defined enough  which makes it rather difficult to extract the card from a reader or adapter this is the first microsd card i have that has had this problem \n",

      "slow compared to some usb drives  the good is it is small and will hold large files  i would recommend this product for cell phone only use  not to be used as a back up usb memory drive for nexus    i would use a high speed usb drive for the nexus   \n",
      "i ve started buying all of my sd cards with the adapter  these is no reason to limit myself with having a large card when i need a small one  at first i was concerned about connection reliability when the small card was inserted into the large one  but i haven t had a single problem so far this one performed as expected and otherwise is more flexible than a standard large size sd card  fully recommended \n",
      "i bought two of these memory cards for use with my logitech alert    e outdoor master security camera s  so far  i have found them to be unreliable  i am not entirely certain if this is because of the camera system or the memory card themselves  the camera frequently will report a memory card error that indicates the card has to be reformatted  this is problematic as if the camera had recorded something that was important  the failure of the sd card would be very troublesome indeed \n",
      "a well made replacement part for use with my system   reads and writes quickly to my camera   the down side   i do not like the size of this card   very tiny and often difficult to remove from my canon camera   not a reflection on the san disk card quality but the industry move into micro miniture cards   i won t buy another camera using micro sd cards \n",
      "the last few days i have been diligently shopping for a microsdxc card to utilize in my new smart phone  i have a long term positive experience using sandisk cards  i quickly became confused about the differences between the so called  mobile  ultra cards and the ultra cards  the performance specs to my  intermediate tech experience  eyes were virtually the same  the prices were also similar  with the  mobile version slightly higher  to finally resolve my confusion i contacted sandisk technical support  to my surprise  the  mobile  version is the older  no longer manufactured version  the ultra is the current model  so i immediately bought the current ultra version  which very fortunately amazon had on sale \n",
      "no problems to report  works as described  scandisk makes a very stable product for temporary storing and later transferring of images and video footage \n",

      "i put this micro sd card in my note ii phone  and i have had a seamless experience with it   programs that are on the card operate as quickly and flawlessly as those that are on my phone s memory   it will hold dozens of programs  and gives me all the expandibility that i will need  unless i start collecting hd movies on my phone     this card seems to be designed specifically for smartphones  and does its job very well   recommended \n",
      "a great memory card  at a very good price  i recently upgraded to this memory card for use in my cell phone  and it has plenty of space to hold all of my music  videos  and photos  i can download as many songs as i want  and take as many photos  at the highest quality  as i want  without having to worry about the memory on my phone filling up i have used sandisk memory cards many times before  and i have always had very good experiences  it is still too early to tell if this card will live up to that standard  but so far  this memory card has worked very well for me the class    rating refers to the speed with which it writes to the card  and i have noticed that it is quicker than my previous micro sd card  as an upgrade and expansion to your smartphone s memory  i highly recommend this card \n",
      "using in a surface pro s microsd slot   i even reformatted to ntfs  which they claim is not recommended  in order to set up a virtual disk file on it and  automount  that virtual disk upon startup so that my music library can be on this  win   is kind of picky about letting you set up what it considers  removable  volumes as directories to be auto scanned for libraries  and this is one workaround  amazing to me that something the size of my pinky nail can hold my entire music collection at a nice high bitrate  and still have much more room left over   one star off because its a tiny bit slow to write to but that might not be fair since i m comparing to full size sd and i did reformat  as i said \n",

      "actually fits and holds data vs others brands which didn t work consistently  probably overkill in terms of size for most uses and requires special usb reader\n",
      "hard to know what to say exactly about a memory card except that it does what it should at a good price   storage case is sturdy enough \n",

      "worked as expected in both my blackberry z   and my hp laptop and is plenty fast   writes at around    mb sec  but reads so far on my pc that i can t get an accurate number for the speed  i gave it four stars because the write speed falls a touch short of the class    rating   it s honestly not enough to be an issue for me  but people who need the speed in a camera might be slightly disappointed  however  the capacity and price more than make up for that in my mind also  makes a great store for content in my blackberry \n",
      "i use it for my galaxy s  and this card crashed on me few times  i lost all my photos and music  thankfully they were all backed up but the worst part is  the card completely stopped working at one point  i had to contact sandisk for a replacement and it was a hassle \n",

      "the class is how fast the memory is read   this is a fast card   there are faster out there  but they are far more expensive  and not worth that expense  in my opinion   does everything perfectly and in a compact package   sandisk is a brand name  and trusted by me   worth the extra buck  since i ve used sandisk since they made  mb cf cards       how far we have come       \n",

      "i accdientally dropped it in my garbage can and it got a tiny drop of water on it  but it still worked perfectly  sandisk cards are always faster read speed than sony s cards  the competitor  and this card is muuuch cheaper than the competitors as well  therefore i have no choice but to give this a   star and a serious recommendation \n",

      "i ve had this card for a couple months now and it is amazing  i use it in my phone so i can put stuff in there rather then use the space on the phone  its extremely responsive and extremely  fast as well  i had a sandisk class   microsd card and this flies past that easily  usually when i would try playing music it would take a couple seconds to start  but using this it starts instantaneous   it was as if i had stored the music on the phone itself  i dont know what else you might use this card for  but if you are looking for a microsd for your phone  look no further\n",
      "unless your really stringent on form factor  and negligible speed  always get these with the adapter  some phones do not transfer data that quickly and the adapter is a life saver  always have it in my pc when dumping large files  speed is actually a big improvement over the   gb card \n",
      "i have found this chip works well even in conditions that aren t ideal  i bought a   gb galaxy s   and tried this chip but the phone has a flaw with the   gb microsoft chips so it worked for a month then would randomly eject the card when i didn t do anything \n",
      "i have a long term positive experience using sandisk cards  i have been very pleased with the way these cards work in my samsung galaxy note      no problems whatsoever and the capacity is huge i quickly became confused about the differences between the so called      mobile      ultra cards and the ultra cards  the performance specs to my      intermediate tech experience      eyes were virtually the same  the prices were also similar  with the      mobile     version slightly higher  to finally resolve my confusion i contacted sandisk technical support  to my surprise  the      mobile      version is the older  no longer manufactured version  the ultra is the current model  so i immediately bought the current ultra version  which very fortunately amazon had on sale \n",
      "this is a very capable microsdhc at a very fair price  i popped it in cell phone  samsung galaxy s   and it got mounted without any hassle  i didn t need any type of formatting  read and write speed is quite fast while using while transferring data to my pc  shipping was fast and tracking it was easy  this a product i highly recommend \n",
      "this thing definitely improved performance over the standard card  transferring music  videos and pictures seem so much more seemless than they were before  prior to this card  i had a   gb standard microsd card that just felt like forever transferring data back and fourth from my phone  i recommend this to anyone who uploads a lot of music and videos onto their mobile devices  transfer rates make up for the slightly higher cost \n",
      "sandisk is now processing my rma   it was used in my galaxy note     its been over a week since i mailed it out  fortunately they paid for shipping  but while it was working  it was awesome      gigabytes of class    accessible data  at the hands of your finger tips  literally micro sd sized   wow  how technology has improved \n",
      "it s an sd card  this one s fast  the read and write speeds are pretty equal on this one  approaching   mbits per second for read and write  i installed linux to this drive for my cubieboard  yeah  read and write speed would definitely be an ultimate determiner of over all system performance with this credit card sized computer sandisk makes nice stuff don t they \n",

      "installed this in my s  and it was immediately recognized by the phone  i performed a format from the phone just to see what it would do  but it didn t give me any further storage capacity with the card  with card overhead it still adds nearly     gb of storage capacity to my bloated s  i tested moving existing applications  pictures  music  and other files back and forth between my phone and the card  absolutely no problems  if you re not going to put a lot of music  pictures or applications on your phone  you ll probably be fine with no additional storage  however  if you re going to add any storage capacity to your phone  why not maximize it with a   gb card for about     \n",

      "so  essentially you have about         gb  but it seems to be quite a bit for me  i have yet to use even a quarter of that  and i take pictures every week  i had a problem with how it transferred some videos to my computer once  but that my be because i forgot to format it and prepare my tablet for removal of the sc card it is definitely surprising how small it is  be careful not to lose it \n",
      "works wonderfully  i had this sd for over nine months and it is still working great  i had trouble getting it to recognized at first by my s  formatting from phone and or generic windows format menu did not resolve this issue so i downloaded easeus partition master and formatted and it has been working like charm ever since write speed      mb s   default cache speed read speed       mb s   default cache speed \n",

      "i bought this for only one use  to put in my samsung galaxy s   i popped in the card  mounted and formatted in settings  and it works like a charm in the phone  however it s in caps pay attention    when i took it out of the phone and put the microsd into the sd adapter and plugged into the sd card slot on the front of my pc win  x    it asked to format the card was already formatted by phone so was confused  so i hit ok  no biggie  it was empty anyways  windows did its thing and when it was      ready to use      it said the card was only  mb it showed      gb in the phone   so my troubleshooting section of mind kicked in and i removed the card  and i just so happen to have a microsd slot in my computer s frontal bay and it wouldn t even show it was connected in windows explorer  so i took it out and put in another microsd card  voila it read  switched them out again  and nothing  so i decided to pull up my paragon hard disk utility  and it showed the same thing as windows  regardless how i tried formatting it  i gave up and put it back in the phone and mounted it my s  said it neded to be formatted  so i formatted it in the phone again and it showed just like it did the first time       gb  i then proceeded to install samsung kies and got my phone hooked up to my pc via usb cable  i opened the phone in windows explorer and right there it shows the phone memory at    gb and the sd card at       gb    i m not quite sure what s going on with that  because the sd slots in my pc read my other cards just fine  but anyway i guess if you plan on using it in your phone or possibly other device exclusively because i can use it like a charm while it s in my phone  otherwise it seems pretty useless  so i guess just depends on what you re using it for  on a side not  be careful when you open the plastic package that contains the micro sd and sd adapter  be sure to open it over a large clear area  i opened it up the the living room with black tile floor and had to get a flashlight to find it when it jumped out on the holder it just sets in the little plastic holder so even the slightest shake will send it flying when opening  i m giving it     on here  but     if you re getting it for a phone  galaxy s  at least because it works fine in mine\n",

      "this chip holds way more than i would normally need but we were going on a three week trip and potentially taking about a million fotos   if you need a large capacity this card was fast for the writes and reads for all the fotos i took   the largest fotos were in the       mb range but most were     mb and there were at least       shots  some were absolute crap but that is the great thing about digifotos  the film is cheap i bought mine here for         and that is still a good price i think for the ability to capture so many fotos and videos  and data if you wish  \n",
      "i own a first generation microsoft surface pro      and it has been a good machine but i was really finding it challenging working within the constraint of    gb of storage space  i had a   gb class    sdxc card  which worked well but was not going to fit the vmware virtual machine i wanted to run off the sd storage  the virtual machine increases in size with regular use  and the operating system i was running is recommended for at least   gb of max storage to operate properly   combined with the files i needed to store  and   gb memory chip was no longer sufficient the sandisk ultra    gb microsdxc class    memory card was able to handle that with ease  however i have found that the virtual machine ran noticeably faster off the   gb chip than this one  i ve actually ordered a second of these to see if i might have just received a flawed chip  if the replacement chip offers improvement i will revise this review  it provides its main selling point  more storage at a relatively low cost  so far has run reliably in my tablet computer if storage space is a significant issue for your device and the memory can make use of    gb sdxc  then i would recommend product \n",
      "this card is great for the price it s exactly what i ordered  works great with my samsung s   plenty of memory \n",
      "the card works well  purchased    gb to use in my phone as that will store a lot of pix and tunes  ah  but the phone does not recognize the     and i can only use about half the memory \n",
      "great price especially for the size and speed  this maxed out my note   smartphone and i am very pleased with the speed of delivery and the cost \n",
      "  gb is pretty good size  and in a cell phone  it s awesome  however  getting it formatted as fat   is not the easiest method  by default  windows   will not allow anything larger than   gb to be formatted as fat    even if you execute a dos command to format to fat    it will fail  there is a fix though  ridgecrop consultants ltd has a program that can be downloaded  i would suggest that you support this free application by sending the guy a few bucks  as he has truly written a great program that works very well in windows    i have used his program       fat  format      to successfully format this   gb microsdxc disk  i then copied all of my contents from my old   gb disk to this one  i inserted the disk into my phone  and whalla  it works great  very pleased with this purchase \n",
      "very happy with this card  it gives my   gb galaxy note ii an extra   gb of storage and it s fast \n",
      "good card for the price   lots of room for music  plays in the sansa mp  without any difficulty or trouble\n",
      "i use this to hold all    gigs of my music on my galaxy s   and i still have room for several seasons of a tv show  definitely a great product the only thing i can complain about is there is a one second gap between songs  at least using google music  i suppose that s the price you pay for this large of storage\n",
      "well  it s a sandisk  never had an issue with one and this one was no exception  good product  good price \n",
      "works as expected  very fast writer  too bad the reader i bought with the disk doesn t work as well as the disk \n",
      "i have been using the device for couple weeks  so far no issue the writing speed is slow  which might be the problem on my laptop not the card \n",
      "while the class    speed is excellent  it s amazing when files will initially transfer at    mb s before settling down to       you do need to use a reader with proper sdxc support  and manually format the card in a good partitioning program  like minitools or easeus  that alone should disqualify it from   stars  for lack of user friendliness  but if it weren t for that  the fast  roomy card is a wonder to own \n",
      "i can t believe how fast this is   i had a class       gb card by imation and it was nothing like the speeds i get out of this \n",
      "i have been using it for several months in a helmet cam  several times a week  no problems so far \n",
      "bought this for my phone and it works without any flaws \n",
      "if you have a microsoft surface or phone that takes these   i use it in my elago drive and nikon dslr \n",
      "   nov        bought the card    jan        card failed it cannot be formatted or used in any way it lasted    months and most of that time i was not even using it \n",
      "  gb sdxc for       ish    amazing price for a great product  popped it into my galaxy s  and have had no problems so far \n",
      "very fast read and write  works great right out of the box   would buy again if i need another one \n",
      "this rocks with my galaxy s  android  i ve got it loaded with movies and pictures for the slow times in my taxi \n",
      "i have this installed in my blackberry z    i have the camera on my phone set to store directly to this little card  it s really a great feeling to take photos all day long and not worry about filling the card up  i really recommend it if you have a phone that allows for external memory expansion  sorry iphone users \n",
      "note   please read the last update  scroll to the bottom    i m leaving this review as   star as it appears to help others who purchased and had a similar experience i give sandisk   stars for customer service and   star for the product  for those manufactured in the past   for those newly manufactured products that contain the software rom fix  i d give the product   stars to all those who purchased this card due to all the great reviews     and then used it in a galaxy s   gs   smartphone for storage  the solution to the problem is not one you can solve without returning the card to sandisk for a replacement under warranty   believe me i tried everything that the google searches returned as solutions    formatting as exfat  formatting in the gs  then copying data to the card while in the phone etc     nothing worked    and so now please stop pulling out your hair and hopefully you will get the same result which i hope to get soon  just rma d and will send it back tomorrow for a free replacement under warranty  the problem  as confirmed from the sandisk customer support rep when i asked specifically asked him    when used in the gs   this card will unmount itself inadvertently  may be true only for cards manufactured before the rom patch described below was implemented in manufacturing    this can cause the data to become corrupt  luckily was not my experience  and   or can be very frustrating as most of us are saving    mp camera pictures to the card  or mp  movies that stop in the middle of the movie  and it unmounts when you view the picture in the gallery or worse  right when you take the picture  this was the issue i experienced    sandisk knows about this issue   again  sandisk knows about the issue and will replace your card  call them  info below  and they will take care of it under warranty   they have a good name for a reason and they want to keep it   sorry sandisk about the   star  but i thought it was the way to get the message out to those searching for a solution   the customer rep told me that sandisk tried to work with samsung to resolve the issue but samsung refused to acknowledge a problem exists with this card and some of their phones  especially their flagship gs  phones    the customer rep told me that to their knowledge the card works fine in regular cameras  not samsung gs  phones with cameras  obviously  and even worked fine in some phones from htc etc  that could accommodate the    gb cards  hence the   star ratings from others   the solution sandisk came up with was to write a patch into the rom of the card itself to specifically address the issue on samsung gs  phones  and maybe other samsung phones like the gs     i was assured that the new card i would get would work flawlessly  will see in about   weeks   i purchased my card from amazon june       so the ones currently being manufactured and the one i should get will have the new patch   however  as sandisk manufactures in batches  like most of the industry   old batches of  unpatched  cards obviously exist in warehouses   i asked about a software patch i could download and was told it s not possible    hence the  hard coded patch  in the card s romso    how to take care of the problem    after speaking with the sandisk us customer support  link and info below   this is what i learned and did go to the sandisk site           call consumer products support  this is the us no         sandisk              tell them that the card is unmounting itself in your gs   i assume this is also a problem experienced by gs  owners too    they will then confirm your information  approve your return        min approval window by mine was basically instantaneously   and then send you emails with a ups return label and instructions    btw  they also asked if i had a magnifying glass to id the serial no  on the card  but i didn t and couldn t read it myself  those numbers are super small printed into the plastic    don t believe me   take a look yourself    i told the rep i couldn t read them and he said no problem  they would process without the serial no   i assume this is because they send you a new replacement card only when they receive your card you send in   makes sense well  that s it   problem  hopefully  solved   let s see in     weeks   the rep was super nice about it and seemed like they were all too familiar with the problem   kudos to sandisk for taking care of it    however  it would be nice if there was some type of communication   notice of the issue besides google info sources  forums etc   i spent hours  maybe a couple of days total hours worth  thinking it was an issue with my phone   my data transfer   oh well  that s how it goes i really hope that this review helps some of you out there with the same problem as me   good luck   btw  i d give the card   stars if this problem was solved in the patched rom of newer cards as the data transfer speeds are awesome on the card  tested transferring data via a card reader hooked to my computer     if the data transfer   remaining mounted in the gs  issue never existed  pre patch of rom  of course  update               all went well with the return of the sandisk storage card   ups shipping took about   days from when i sent it  sandisk verified the warranty claim   day later and   hours later that same day  my replacement card had been shipped  waiting on the new card now  but expect to test it out very soon  early next week    will update the post after testing out the new card   just as a reference  i ve been using a   gb micro sd hc sandisk card in the gs  since having shipped the   gb card   obviously it s a different card and not the micro sd xc kind  other than a bit slower access speeds to the card  absolutely zero problems     well if you don t count that it s basically filled up  hence why the   gb option is great on the gs   so it proves the point on the problem with the early build micro sd xc   gb cards i m happy to see that my review has helped some others out there   good luck to you in your warranty claim  my experience with sandisk customer support has been excellent so far update               received the new replacement sandisk storage card just a few days ago  shipping back to me once they agreed it was defective was a very short time window    have had it running in the galaxy s  for a few days now without any jumps  stutters or card unloading in the middle of picture or video taking   card seems to work flawlessly as the sandisk rep mentioned it would  one would think it s such a short time to test after a few days of use  but if this were not fixed already it would have dismounted in the first    minutes    that s how often and how fast it was occurring  so it would seem the problem is solved  the new sd card makes the phone even more responsive when moving between pictures in the gallery and performing other tasks like copying files to the card   thanks sandisk   unless i update this review by next week  you will know that the problem has been fixed good luck to those with similar problems as we now know how to get it fixed thanks to sandisks great responsive customer service update               this is the last update to this review just to  close the loop    the new replacement card from sandisk has been running flawlessly for about   weeks now   i have not experienced any of the initial problems   sandisk really did fix the issues in the new batch of cards update               the card has been running in my gs  flawlessly since replacing it around aug   st   pretty good track record so far        months  so it appears to be fixed with the newly manufactured  replacement  cards for those that have left comments that i should change the rating upwards now that the issue is fixed  see my addition at the beginning of this review     when searching for a solution to a problem with a purchased product  most people start at the   star reviews to see what others have experienced   this is especially true for products with a lot of reviews  this is what i did in the beginning with this product    therefore i think leaving it at   star and adding the comments at the beginning should clarify the review thanks to review commenter  da shocker  for his input   i think he sums it up very well when it comes to the value of files stored on media like this  one more thing   to those not happy with the one star rating by this person go ahead buy one  take tons of pics vids and save some music on there then when the card crashes come back and give it a five star  a card cost          pictures from a vacation or family event are priceless    \n",
      "got this micro data card for a digital camera that shoots in hd  it came with a class   card but the video clips were blocky  i had a class   and tested it in the camera with some improvement and at the advice of youtuber techmoan  this guy does the best tech reviews on the web  i ordered this class    card  it solved the blocky issue and is a great value for the money \n",

      "i purchased this for a cheap android tablet   i figured i d try a cheap tablet first  and if i decided i wanted to go with an android tablet  i d get something good later   but either way  the memory card will be used in one item or another  so i wanted to get a good one   like any other sandisk product i ve purchased  this card is top notch   comes with the  in my opinion  necessary  sd card adapter   class    speed really makes a difference when you have the card filled with music movies apps \n",
      "i bought this for my sony action cam   at    p   fps i get    hrs of recording which is awesome   this card is more than fast enough for that cam   the price was great too   it comes with the regular sd card adapter so don t worry about buying one in addition   the packaging can be difficult to get into though \n",
      "i ve had this card for about a year and i ve been very careful with it and it just broke when i popped it out of sd card slot on my phone but it was very reliable card when it wasn t broken\n",

      "never had a problem with any sd cards prior  and always had a good track record with sandisk products card was working great at first  used exclusively in my samsung galaxy s   enjoyed the extra space got the   gb card  and transfers were pretty quick  i started to see  about a month ago  that the phone would randomly give me  sd card unexpectedly removed  error maybe once a week  the last   weeks  i also started seeing  frequently   sd card safe to remove  randomly pop up at least once a day as well as the  unexpected  removal error every few days  today the card stopped reading all together the card was first inserted w  the phone off  when i bought it  although i never formatted it  it worked properly  i also never removed the card from the phone in order to possibly corrupt it from improper removal  so the card just seems to have died of it s own accord  i never thought to check it s temperature after transferring large files so i m not sure if i had the same issue as another reviewer contacted sandisk  waiting for reply  if they replace the card and it works well  i will revise this review update         got a replacement card after about a week and a half  sandisk supplied a shipping label for me which is always a plus  i ve had the replacement in my s  for     months now and still going strong  i ve also used it with the adapter in my gopro  card is working well and hopefully it continues to do so  updated to   stars since i haven t had a single problem with this card  the first one started showing issues fairly soon after installing   maybe there was just a bad batch of the card for spell there \n",
      "decent price on    gb  works as it should  no problems  not sure if the speeds actually matter with mobile devices  maybe for transferring media to pc faster actually helps  either way  it works great \n",
      "this is my second time to buy this product and will give it as a gift to my friend  packaging is nice and received in good condition \n",
      "the   gb card i purchased actually contains  gb of flash memory and some kind of hack that causes it to appear as a   gb drive in various drives and readers  of course  this took me a while to figure out since i only just got around to copying more than  gb of data to the card  but with some testing i have nonetheless discovered this to be the case the card i bought was in amazon frustration free packaging  i don t know if cards purchased that way are less likely to be counterfeit than retail packaged versions  but i suspect that i will stick with manufacturer packaging from now on \n",
      "i have purchased   of these cards   i have attempted to use them in my gopro herohd  samsung galaxy s   asus tf     and in all of them they end up corrupting out of the blue with no warning   i then have to perform a deep recovery to get the files   i will never buy these ultra models again \n",
      "had to send it back to sandisk   they did replace it at no cost   which is nice   but still     if i had lost a bunch of data i would have been pretty bummed   i used it in my phone to store music   one day i turned on my phone and it said      can t read card       that was it   i tried putting it in my computer to reformat  wasn t even recognized as a drive at all \n",

      "while sandisk s packaging makes much mention of android phones and tablets  there s nothing android specific about this microsdhc card  i bought the   gb version to use in an automotive  dashcam   where it works perfectly the packaging also says that an android app is  included   suggesting it is preinstalled on the card  but the  very   fine print on the back says you have to download it  unlike another sandisk flash product i got recently  there was no  bloatware  preinstalled on the card i like that this card is also said to be resistant to temperature extremes  important to me as it will be behind a car windshield and will get hot at times \n",

      "with most of the world s electronic devices finally standardizing to sd  thank you sony for finally adopting this standard   it seems most things we own work on either the microsd or regular sd card   that s why this little package is so handy   you get both in one neat little package and at   gb  you ll have plenty of space to store most of your programs  files  etc on your device the class    rating  ability to move data on off card at the current maximum speed  is a must for anyone that doesn t want to sit for vital seconds waiting for data to write to the card   and sandisk has proven themselves over the years as making a quality product   sure  you may occasionally find a dud in their inventory  but they are quick to fix replace it and that is what matters most   buying cheaper cards will land you with a read write error when you can least afford it   don t be the person that loses those important family photos or that document that is due today because of a cheap and defective card i purchased this particular card for my asus transformer  as it fits nicely into the pad itself   and with the optional keyboard attachment  which is capable of holding standard sd cards  it fits there as well   making this the perfect solution for my extra memory needs and at a much better bargain than most competitors   you can certainly purchase more internal memory on your iproduct or android device  most seem to have   gb or   gb variants   but why spend the extra cash for   gb extra  when you can buy far more in an external card \n",

      "i ordered these cards at a great price during black friday week weekend   i began loading some files  music  videos  pics  etc    the first card worked without any problems   the second card started giving me cyclic redundancy errors   at first  i thought it was my hard drive that was failing  and tried to copy the same files to a flash drive which worked just fine   ok  maybe i received a dud  and tried with another card from my purchase   same results  cyclic redundancy error   i started searching online  and found a utility via one of the reviews on amazon called h testw   ran the test on both cards  and it reported errors   it also reported write speed of only  mb sec  which is way below advertised speeds   these items were in retail packaging  and i remember reading about the bulk package items being fakes   i guess the retail package cards aren t any better i should have waited to do the refund because now i have to process the refund seperately   i will test another card to see if i have better luck   i wanted to leave a   star  but i gave   stars since   card worked so far   i have   more to test very dissapointed because i was a fan of the sandisk ultra series for being reliable  but i guess they are cheaping out on quality to increase their profit   i would have been extremely upset if i used these cards for anything important \n",
      "i a using this card with a sansa  sandisk  mp  player and it is working flawless  i am glad  but i cannot imagine what could go wrong with a card like this  either it works or it does not  and mine is working  anyway  i would buy one of these again without a doubt \n",

      "it s hard for me to evaluate this product in detail  but i can report that it works just in my samsung galaxy s   i turned the phone off  probably much better to insert remove cards with the phone turned off  and then slid the card into the slot inside the back of the phone  when i turned the phone back on  there was no obvious indication that i had made any changes at all  however  when i started to take photos  the camera reported that it would now be storing pictures on the card instead of the phone s internal flash memory  so everything seems to work well \n",

      "maybe there is nothing that can be done and it is just the way the technology is at this time  but to me it seems that the   gb sd cards have very limited uses at this time because they are formatted in whats called  exfat    instead of the standard fat   to get   gb from a   gb card   after receiving my card and inserting it into my new android tablet with  jelly bean  it was recognized and it did show i had   gb available   i then removed the card from the tablet and inserted it into my computers  a win  and a vista  and tried to transfer files  photos and videos from my laptop to the card they would not transfer   after some research on the internet it appeared that the card had to be reformatted from the new  exfat    to the standard fat     all my files were created in win xp and win vista   fat     i also have a win  machine i recently purchased and can easily move all types of files between all the machines and memory cards and flash drives but could not transfer any files to this card from any computer as long as the card was formatted in exfat     i had read on the internet about reformatting  the cards and it working   my win  machine does not even have the option to format to standard fat    it only has nstf and exfat     my older computers have the older fat   format option and it took my vista computer with a dual core processor    hours to reformat the card to fat     after reformatting i was able to easily transfer my files  photos  and videos on my xp and vista computers but not the win  computer   the card works in my tablet and i am able to access and use all the files i transferred to the card in fat   with my vista computer on the tablet   but after reformatting it now the card only has   gb of space available  so it was essentially reformatted the   gb card into a   gb card   i will keep the card because i have a lot of work into it reformatting and transferring files and hopefully in the future i can reformat it again back to exfat   if and when exfat   catches on and an os is made that can seamlessly use files created in both fat   and exfat     this seems to be a good card that works well in certain situations but my advice do your research on what you have and how you will use the card because this is not simply a big gb card that can be used for everything in every device  unless all your files  photos  and videos are in  or will be created with  exfat   there are some real draw backs to this card and you might be better off just buying multiple lower gb cards if you really need this much storage space in a micro sd card   or perhaps cards you already own can be reformatted into exfat   and double the capacity if your computer has the exfat   reformat option   i have not tried it but based on my experience the last few days it seems like it would work if exfat   works for you  i gave   stars because it does work  but i feel sandisk not fully explaining how they are getting   gb out of this card and the possible problems a consumer might have with it is misleading advertising \n",

      "this product was formatted and installed in a gopro hero   black  i get      hours of recording time on     p   fps  no issues so far and don t expect any since sandisk is basically the standard for solid state memory \n",

      "needs little to no formatting and i have yet to see a sandisk fail  don t cut corners  almost every other brand of sd cards will fail on you except these  tried numerous brands with my devices  just remember it takes a bit for devices to buffer the information off of the sd card and static can corrupt any sd card which is usually easily fixed with a formatting  always back up your documents to a pc mac as soon as possible oh  and if you create playlists  slideshows  etc  on devices and remove the sd card  the device will not be smart enough to re compile it after you put the sd card back in and you will end up with blank playlists even though you have the songs so watch out lastly if this sd card doesn t work for you for whatever reason google sd card formatting and it should help you out  these   gb versions don t seem to have formatting issues like the   gb ones do but even then formatting to fat   fixes it \n",

      "i use this for a raspberry pi  in the sd adapter  and it works so far also appeared to be the genuine part  although the prolific sandisk counterfeiters have gotten really sneaky in recent years i like getting microsdhc cards because they can be adapted to different device sizes   for example  let s say i buy a used phone or e reader that needs a memory card  and i m not using my pi    i can just take the pi s card  take it out of the adapter  and put it in the other device  rather than pay more money and wait a week for delivery of a new one \n",

      "this micro sd card is perfect for any smartphone user looking to expand the storage on their device  i personally am using one in my samsung galaxy note    works like a charm  it is adequately fast  cheap  and fairly reliable  if you are looking for extremely fast speeds however  you should consider the sandisk extreme series which are the fastest microsd cards in the world  my card came with an adapter that this card plugs into and it becomes a full sized sd card  if you are looking to use this in a camera or any other device that uses sd cards  please look elsewhere  these cards are not nearly as fast as the full sized sd cards used in cameras  the adapter should only be used for transporting data from the phone or other device  to a computer  all in all  these are a great buy for any smartphone user looking for a higher storage capacity  the price fluctuates often  so catch em while there cheep  i got mine for around     \n",
      "i bought this on august of        as of april      the card stopped functioning   it can still be read  but the writing capability is gone   that s less than one year   i m extremely disappointed in the longevity of this card   my usage of it has been on my galaxy s    i have about   gb of data in it   guess i m going to have to look for another card that has a longer lifespan than this one \n",

      "i routinely use sdxc cards up to    gb  and this card was unreadable on arrival   both of my pcs said it needed to be formatted  and as a last resort i let one of them try  windows   i with up to date sdxc drivers   and it could not format it   it s on its way back to amazon   i m glad their returns are so easy \n",

      "it is a memory card  fast as any other class   card  and sandisk units rarely lose data   i wish these guys would keep their marketing on the backside leaving some white space on top so we could write things   the cheapo brands do this but not the big guys   idiots \n",
      "so this product is a large disappointment   bought it to use in my tablet but the card is forever getting corrupted    i ve reformatted the card a few times but it s to the point now that even a reformat doesn t work    wasted money   don t recommend purchasing \n",
      "my first card ordered was bad   my tablet and my computer wouldn t write to it  wouldn t read it  amazon replaced it immediately and my new card is perfect  reads and writes very fast  much faster than the hc in my phone  i m glad i got the hc   for my tablet \n",

      "bought this for my wife s samsung tl     which kept locking up with a lesser speed sd card  after throwing this card in there  the camera rarely locks up when taking pictures back to back  if you are shooting     mp and taking pictures back to back or shooting hd vid  it s a good idea to upgrade to a class    card \n",
      "my samsung galaxy note   came with   gigs of internal memory  i discovered that apps can only be written to the internal   gigs of memory so i didn t want to fill up the internal memory with pictures  videos  music  etc   i purchased the    gb san disk ultra microsdxc class    card  i found a video on youtube to learn how to insert the card since i could find nothing on it in the phone s user guide   it s real easy  turn the note phone off  remove the note s back plate  you see a plaque saying sd card in the upper left quadrant of the phone  simply place the microsd card face up with the metallic pins facing down and towards the right into the depressed slot area to the left of the sd card plaque  then slowly and gently slide the microsd card under the plaque until it clicks  if it isn t in correctly  it will tend to move back out from under the plaque  do not force  replace the back plate on the phone  turn the phone on   go to settings  storage   at the bottom of the page  you will see sd card   if the microsd card was inserted correctly  you will see the additional gbs of storage displayed there   you will also see reformat sd card and remove sd card   use these settings to erase data from the microsd card  and to remove it from the phone   do not try to remove the microsd card from the phone without first activating the remove sd card setting   you can damage the card and the phone   the card came quickly and san disk is a reliable brand  it s great to have the class    rating too \n",

      "i ve purchased this microsd card back in january for use in my tablet and my android smartphone   i ve used this card extensively to transfer music and files and i ve found it s rather interchangeable and versatile across a number of surfaces   the card hasn t corrupted itself or become unusable at any point so i figure  for the value  that s pretty much what i want   and    gb covers the amount of storage i would want for my mobile devices \n",
      "i ve used this card for about   months now and have not had a bit of trouble   i notice to delay while the phone writes to the memory after taking pictures or shooting full hd video \n",
      "i wasn t absolutely certain if this would work in my samsung galaxy siii  an sgh i   m  from a regional carrier here in alaska i read several reviews  but took a chance the   gb card would work in my device and was pleased when it arrived opting for the      frustration free package      it was a very simple matter to open the little cardboard envelop to retrieve the contents   a side note here  i do appreciate the amazon packaging for items such as this  where a clamshell type of container adds no value   the card is well made and seems a quality product   installed the card and it was recognized instantly on boot   the full capacitywas recognized maybe i am old school when it comes to memory cards  but i always format them in the device i intend on using them  at least initially    in this case  there were no issues while i haven t scientifically measured read   write speeds of the card  performance is respectable   i have suffered no issuesrelated to the operation of the card i would highly recommend this product if you are looking for this capacity and your device will accept the microsdxc format   to that end  several friends have purchased  and been satisfied  with this memory card in their devices \n",
      "i will keep it short and sweet for potential buyers looking for facts and not b s i own two of the   gb size of these cards for about   months now  they do work fairly well with cell phones and tablets  yet not so good with cameras  in fact these cards failed to work with my gopro hero  camera and the customer service rep from gopro claimed  and i happen to agree with him  that this card is not a true class    card let alone uhs   benchmarks with my evo  g with all allocation sizes the write speed never passed beyond  mb s while read speeds wondered around   mb s far below advertised speeds  well write speeds arent technically advertised  probably because they are of class   level benchmarks with crystal mark reported speeds even lower  due to adapter  with write speeds around  mb s while read speeds wondered around   mb s needless to say  if you are not worried about speeds and only about storage  these are perfect  if you want to use them for shooting high definition raw footage however  i suggest you not to loose your money on this  because even if your write speeds are around   mb s as the card begins to decay it will slow down to become useless again this review is based on gopro camera and high definition raw recording   for cell phones or for storage it works perfectly well with a bit of false advertisement  \n",
      "just what i needed for my digital music collection on my phone \n",
      "memory either works or not what more can be said than it works as designed   i was very happy with the price \n",
      "more than a year in and still going strong  it boosts the memory of the tablet so i can store movies for trips and the tablet stores big files there automatically to save it s own brain for more important things \n",
      "no complaints   worked in every piece of electronics i ve tried them in   i ve run across fake chips online before  but these are high quality at a good price \n",
      "not as fast as advertised most of the time  actually slowed down my note   when i filled it with movies leaving only about  gb free  switched to a faster card due to that  but it could also be the phones fault  all in all it s a good card with good speed and size for the money \n",
      "product supplied as described    gb micro sdhc class    card with adapter  i purchased this to use in my samsung galaxy tablet and it works perfectly  it is easy to identify from other micro flash cards you may have because of its red grey color  this is a great memory solution for your stored media for any device \n",
      "product works as advertised  no issues with install or general use in my mobile phone  it doesn t seem particularly snappy  but that may be more the phone than anything else \n",
      "quick little puppy  sandisk makes nice quality stuff with one exception the adapter that came with it to let it work in the bigger slot failed horribly after   days adapters  psh but my transformer likes it  treats it like a child and it fits very snugly into the latching system  a recent store bought one wiggles    \n",
      "replaced a smaller and slower micro sd card in my phone  i ve had other brands corrupt and die in the past  i ve grown to only trust sandisk it is faster than most other micro sd cards  the price was right at     \n",
      "simply put the card works well in my note    gives me the extra space needed and to date has worked flawlessly  i upgraded from a   gb sandisk to the    gb with no issues  plenty of space available now in my phone and i can keep movies and music local  some people have scoffed online about using such a large card but the reality of it is that you don t always have data service and when that time comes  such as when you re on a plane  its nice to have access to some movies and music that you ve kept on local storage so far its worked in my note   and sg  \n",
      "so i m not going to pretend to be an expert on sd cards  but i still like this one  it is relatively inexpensive  works wonderfully for the movies i want to store and watch on my samsung galaxy tab        and i haven t had a single problem with storage yet \n",
      "still working with no problems so far  so it seems to be reliable  not sure what else to say  but they want more words \n",
      "the card arrived promptly and has worked flawlessly in a dashcam  would recommend purchase to others if they need this kind of card \n",
      "the card looks good  works fine  i didn t do too much test with it my only complaint until now is the package  there s a line marked on the back for you to cut  i cut along the line  and nothing happened  no opening at all  all cardboard glued tightly  so i cut near the card  only to found i cut the supposed plastic card case storage shell  now i took it out  and no storage case to store  not a functional problem  but annoying \n",
      "the package arrived on time  it s very well packed and it s got an adapter  it works perfectly with my phone  though it doesn t allow a computer format  once it s been on the phone  so it asks you to erase everything before you use it on a computer  so if you re planning on buying this for different purposes and devices  gotta be aware of this  i just need for my phone  so i transfer files with my usb cable  that works just right  i also give it a   star because it says there are   gb  but even when it s totally formatted it only reaches to   gb  sooo  i don t know where my other   gb are   anyways  overall it s working well  i do think it s expensive for what it is \n",
      "there really isn t much to say about a micro sd card  it either works or it doesn t  i bought this to install in my phone and it seems to be working fine  the fit was perfect and the performance is totally satisfactory  i ve never had any trouble with sandisk products and this will likely be no exception  it was a great value compared to places i had priced locally \n",
      "the sandisk ultra   gb memory card has shown no sign of not being exactly what i needed   a good deal \n",
      "this card has worked flawlessly in my phone for about three months  i had an smaller and slower card in it that this replaced  when doing pictures and video you can definitely tell the difference in write speed between a class ten and four \n",
      "this chip is holding all my music and photos so they are ready to share with friends and family on my tablet  quick response and no drop outs or lags   price was amazing  \n",
      "this is a great sd card  it s very fast and works well   i have been using it for my gopro with no complaints \n",
      "this is a very fast microsd card compared to the class   speeds  it looks nice and it works  i m not sure what else i can say other than that i have no problems with it and it hasn t died on my yet it s been about   months at least now in my samsung galaxy s   the s  had a reputation for breaking sandisk sd cards for some reason and it s only randomly unmounted about   times but easily remounted with a take out and put back in with maybe a restart on the phone to refresh some apps to see it  i think this is just because the galaxy s  tends to get really hot right below the sd card which might damage it a bit  i don t think they put it in a good spot but that has nothing to do with the card itself so just get it if you want a nice sd card \n",
      "this is the best accessory that you can buy for your smartphone  simple explanation    i loaded all my hd movies onto this micro sd card  inserted it into my samsung galaxy s   and it plays them superbly without any delays  as it it up to   mb s read speed    the most important reason for this being the best accessory for your phone is to think about this  the premium you pay for an iphone   gb is       the price you pay for this   gb micro sd card is      depends on amazon s pricing at the time   that means you get the same thing for      less  and you can interchange your sd card between devices  if you buy a new tablet for example  no brainer note that it reads only at   mb s  so a  gb hd movie will take about         minutes to load up \n",
      "this is the biggest memory card i have at    gig   it works fine   i am using it on an   inch dell tablet with windows   and a solid state   gig hard drive \n",
      "this is the latest version of the microsd cards class     i purchased it for asus memopad hd   tablet which i use mostly to play movies for my son  since all of our movies are in hd i wanted to ensure i have a fast storage card so movies can play smoothly this is also very important when taking pictures or videos  the faster the sd card is  the faster the device will process and store the picture and release the camera for the next picture   with android     jellybean  google introduced burst picture taking which allow you to long press the shutter and the camera will take several pictures in a row  this is great if you are trying to shoot something in motion  a fast sd card is essential for this feature to work properly \n",
      "this is the sd card you need for your smart phone  i bought this for my s  and been using it for over a year and it works perfect  i don t think ill ever have to worry about running out of space  plus the price on amazon  you cant beat it \n",
      "this is the second one of these sandisk    gb microsdhc cards i have bought   one i installed in my samsung galaxy s  and this one i installed in my samsung galaxy tab           these are excellent options for both devices to expand storage   one of the reasons i went with samsung products is because you can use microsd cards unlike apple iphone products where you can t \n",
      "this provides plenty of storage capacity for your tablet and mobile devices   i ve put this into all my cellphones and android tablets  after twelve months of use  downloading music  videos  apps   there is plenty of room left the class    version is also great for phone tablet cameras as well for a stand alone camera  yes i still use a digital camera   so yesterday   this is a must for hd action video camera recorder as well  the price continues to drop so it is very affordable now   unless your device can take the   gb version   i d go with the higher capacity for video recording devices \n",
      "this was the perfect addition to my surface tablet   it came in easy to open packaging and it worked from the moment i pout it in the microsoft surface tablet   expanded my    g tablet to a lot more storage for movies and music \n",
      "this works on my phone and is amazing  however it seems to transfer pretty slowly   i move a lot of music and movies on and off my phone so it can be annoying   i m not sure if my phone or this card is the weak link though   i have note   anyways  it was cheap and it works  that is all that matters   buy it   \n",
      "this works perfect in my dell venue pro    all i had to do was to reformat the card before using it \n",
      "wanted more space on my smartphone   works great  what else can i say  thinking of buying another as a back up for my stuff \n",
      "we bought this to go with our new samsung galaxy tab    works great and allows us to add a lot of videos onto our tablet \n",
      "we use these for our samsung galaxy  s phones and they are amazing because i can now take a gazillion pictures  i only wish that i could separate the pictures on the memory card into folders but that is a samsung issue  not the memory card issue \n",
      "what is there to say about a sd card  it works  and it s a class    card  the price was decent  i needed one for my android tablet  shopped around and this one seemed like the best choice \n",
      "what more can you ask for    no errors ever detected by android os  and having this unit plugged into my tablet means i m never without data or pictures that i want \n",
      "when i first got this card  it worked perfectly in my galaxy s  phone   then  i rooted the phone and installed the cyanogen mod rom to gain additional features not available from my carrier   the card was instantly corrupted by that rom  because it s formatted with a filing system the rom doesn t support   fortunately there was nothing on the card i couldn t replace i ended up having to use a third party utility to format the card with a filing system supported by both windows and the rom once properly formatted  there have been no corruption or data loss issues and the card has performed well if you are using a stock galaxy s  rom  you ll have no problem at all   you ll find the card roomy and fast \n",

      "i just bought two of these for our two new samsung galaxy iv smart phones   the adapters will make it possible for the card readers on our computers to accept these microsd cards if we find it worthwhile to pull them out of the phone case rather than use the usb      dongle      to move information on and off the phones  but   most importantly  now i don t worry about storing audio books  favorite playlists  and video clips i might want to show someone on the phones \n",

      "i originally bought a samsung equivalent and then my phone was stolen  so i made the switch   i have done some research and realized the class    and the sdxc are very important as it is the quickest rate of transfer   however when you read samsung s description and this one  samsung claims    mbps and sandisk has    mbps  after using both they are identical   the class and the sdxc are the most important  they are almost absolutely identical   samsung s equivalent is     and this was under       i haven t noticed a bit of difference  besides that maybe this mircosd card is a bit quicker and easier to move files around   i store a lot on my phone  which is a samsung note    this works beautifully \n",

      "it is extremely small  so small in fact  that it could easily get lost  so i recommend that once it s in  you leave it in  but it s a great idea  to allow the camera s  phone s or any other device to be that much smaller  i ve only had it for a short while  but so far so good \n",

      "well not much to say   its a good mmc and its fast enough and that s about all you can ask for  using for more storage on my tablet update  stopped working after a while  computer said the mmc had an error and after an hour i could not fix  it became locked and would not unlock with any sd adapters i used and because its locked it would not format or erase and wouldn t even read because of the error  it stopped working after amazons very short return policy so i was out of luck with them  luckily sandisk has a very long     lifetime  for its ultra brands  even though it was a hassle and all through email only i got a replacement and that s why i only took one star off\n",
      "reliable and inexpensive  however  it s quite slow  far  far slower than the   gb samsung pro microsdxc  the samsung works well for interactive use while i would only use this sandisk card for applications where speed isn t important \n",

      "i bought this primarily to use in my surface pro  it would randomly dismount itself  i do not know if it was the surface s fault or the card s fault  upon doing a little internet searching  i found this to be a common problem with sandisk cards and the surface pro  i used another brand microsdxc and it has worked fine \n",
      "this card was used in a phone without a large amount of write stress  which does shorten the life of the card   it was not written to over and over in the phone  the card is now totally unwriteable   on a mac  a linux machine  or the phone   writes all  seem  to succeed but even low level reformats don t actually  do  anything   the exact same files are there after every change  untouchable and frozen forever    months of use out of a memory card and then a really weird failure like this  neither the mac  linux machine  or phone reports any error  is not acceptable quality from sandisk \n",
      "   and they re right this microsdhc card is fast  i started formatting it a little behind another class    card  not a uhs    card and it formatted all   gb ahead of the transcend   gb card   which is no slouch either  it s the fastest flash card i ve sent yet  i doubt you will be disappointed unless you re an alien with more advanced technology \n",
      "i cannot gauge if its better or faster than a class   or    i use it in my mobile and it saves pictures just as quickly  dont see a difference  but it has advertised capacity and works ok \n",

      "  gb for this price is a nice deal  especially when you are trying to add storage capability for a tablet or phone   keep in mind that not all phones tablets devices support   gb  so you may have to get the    gb instead   performance is very good  especially when weighing with price and capacity \n",
      "i own several video recording devices  surveillance  car based dvr systems  etc    and the sandisk class    cards  always use class    cards when dealing with hd video  are the only ones which survive these extreme environments i have been using sandisk for years  and while i do admit to trying other great brands once in a while  i always come back to sandisk  and will stick with it many non sandisk brand cards might advertise class    as well  but don t achieve the same writing speeds   in fact  cheaping out on these cards may result in your video recording devices to become unstable  or worse  corrupt data highly recommended \n",
      "i have had this for   months  and the sd card already stopped deleting files and keeping pictures   i have tried reformatting  and nothing helps   not cool update   april           i contacted sandisk and i am sending the problematic card back for warranty replacement   i hope this will resolve the issue with the card   i will keep you updated once the process is complete \n",

      "whether i m on vacation or just taking photos and videos around the house i don t trust any other memory cards to keep all my memories   i bought this card mainly for my contour roam   helmet cam  but i ve been using sandisk compact flash cards in my canon dslr and sandisk sd cards in my panasonic hmc   video camera and i ve never had a single problem   they don t fail  i ve never had a file corrupted  they ve survived x rays at the airport and extreme weather conditions   sometimes i m tempted with the prices of other memory cards but in the end i go with the sandisk for that warm and fuzzy feeling of knowing all my photos and videos will be perfectly safe \n",

      "the product is ok  but my card does not acheive the rated write speed of    mb sec   most applications probably don t need to hit    mb sec  but my gopro hero   does need the full bandwidth and thus would bomb on me sometimes   as tested  my card got between      mb sec using the larger block sizes   i complained to sandisk about it and they allowed me to send it in for a replacement which i did  and took almost   weeks   but the replacement behaved the same way   i would say this card is ok for most applications  but if you need top end speed  i would go with another card   i bought my card in may      and had it replaced in august      so hopefully they have fixed this problem by now \n",

      "i was out of space on my droid razr   gb and still had an empty microsd slot  so i figured i d pick this up seeing as how it is a reputable brand in flash memory  i am glad i went with the sandisk ultra  because there is seemingly no difference in speed between this drive and the built in internal memory of my phone  i record a lot of videos with my phone and i ve been recording straight to this card in hd with no problems at all installation was a breeze  i took the memory card out of the package and inserted into my phone  then my phone brought up a menu asking if i wanted to move my music  videos  and photos to the memory card  i selected all three categories  and in minutes it had moved all of my media onto the memory card  i didn t even have to do anything else  i had read some other reviews that said they had to reformat the card or mess around with moving files by hand  but i didn t have to do any of that i haven t tried using the included sd adapter yet  but i imagine it will work as well as any other adapter  the adapter and memory card were both shipped in a little clear plastic case  which makes it easier to carry the adapter around with you  so you have it with you when you need it the price on this card when i bought it was a few dollars more than the generic brands  i decided to spend a few extra dollars on it since i would be really upset if i lost all my photos and videos due to a corrupt memory card  i am very satisfied with the product and i would highly recommend it to anyone looking to increase the storage capacity of their phone or anything else this would fit in \n",

      "plenty of room for all my photos  music and random documents i decide to load onto my phone  it works great with my htc one m  and apps stored on the sd card run as smooth as they did on the phone itself  file writes were as fast as i expected from an xc i card the only downside  and this is minor  is the microsd adapter it comes with seems a little cheap  but hey  that s not the reason i bought this card \n",

      "not much to say about this other than it works fine   the included adapter was difficult to remove the microsdhc card from  but that may be due to my big fingers  plus the card is very small as one would expect from micro naming    the speed is more than adequate with no buffering issues noticed from video capture on a phone at hd      resolution   recommended \n",

      "i bought this to stash all  the ones i would watch on the go  the movies and songs that i previously owned to my new galaxy s   i am extremely impressed with how fast the device works outside of the phone and inside when used by the phone  it is dramatically slow when the phone with the sd card in it is wired up to the computer via usb  but that is really unrelated and the process isnt painstaking  fast and huge in capacity  definitely a must for enthusiasts note  as of ics  android has stopped allowing the movement of apps into the sd card  so if youre planning on installing games onto the card  you will need to have a rooted phone  the card is very useful for other things  music and video  and roms if youre interested  even then \n",

      "update          well  i suppose nothing lasts forever  after almost a year  the card has gone bad  i use the card a lot in my smartphone   a t mobile samsung galaxy s   sgh t      all my photos  voice recordings  and downloads go on this card  and the downloads are transferred to my computer almost daily via usb cable  a few days ago  a video file i transferred to my computer refused to play correctly  no video  and the audio was skipping and squealing  which i recognize as the sound of a corrupted file  i thought maybe the transfer didn t complete  tried it again  same result  i tried to play the file right on the phone  and it didn t play on my phone  i knew there was a problem  i tried copying the video to my phone storage and playing it there  still no luck  then i deleted the video and decided to download it directly to my phone  not the sd card   eureka  it played perfectly i formatted the sdxc card twice   once from the phone and once through windows   and tried the same test  downloaded video file to the card  then to the phone  same result both times   it wouldn t play on the sd card  but it did on the phone  all videos used to play perfectly on the sd card  finally  i swapped out the card for my older  sandisk ultra   gb micro sdxc card  like magic  it worked perfectly no matter what i played on it  so yeah  the   gb card is dead  i should note that the card performed flawlessly for nearly a year up until a few days ago thankfully  sandisk ultra products like this carry an incredible lifetime warranty   or    years for regions that don t recognize  lifetime   their extreme line of cards raise that to    years  i ve contacted their support for an rma so i ll update this review as events unfold  if they replace it quickly  i ll bump this back up to   stars original review i m using a samsung galaxy s  smartphone  sandisk ultra micro sd cards have never failed me  and this one s no exception  i used to have a   gb card  they re fast and reliable and never corrupt data  which is more than can be said for some cheaper brands like pny  those fail quite often   i can t wait to get the new    gb model \n",

      "   update               so my lovely wife bought me a samsung galaxy tab   for father s day and i ve been loving it ever since   just as other with samsung products  the galaxy tab   has the ability to add a microsd card to expand the memory on the device   since it s been over a year  i decided to do some more research to see if sandisk offered anything new   as of            their product lineup for microsd cards from worst to best  performance wise  are the as follows sandisksandisk ultrasandisk ultra plussandisk extremesandisk extreme plussandisk extreme pronow  the difference between all of these cards are simply the speed in which you can read write data to the card   yes  the published rating of most all these cards  except the sandisk regular  are class    uhs i but that s just a rating    actual real world performance does get better with each model  but with faster cards come more expensive prices   since amazon doesn t carry the ultra plus model of microsd card  i had to do direct comparisons between the sandisk ultra           extreme           and extreme plus          as mentioned in my earlier review  i purchased the sandisk ultra for my galaxy s    my question was  did i want to pay over     more for a card that is faster than the one i already owned   or i could pay almost double to get sandisk s  nd most fastest microsd card the ultra works perfectly fine for my style of usage  storing capturing pictures   hd video and movie playback  on my phone   so in the end  i ended up just buying another sandisk ultra   gb card   i use my cell phone  more  than i do my tablet and if the card is good enough for my phone  it s good enough for my tablet   i don t own a  k hd camera or anything like that  so i honestly didn t see a need to get one of the faster cards at this time i am now a proud owner of   sandisk ultra cards and have absolutely   issues with it in my samsung devices    original review              i haven t had to buy a microsd card in a long time  the last time i bought one was for my cell phone over   years ago  but since my cellular contract was up  i knew i would have to get a newer card in addition to my new phone  the samsung galaxy s   reason for this is because i knew my small   gb microsd card wasn t going to cut it doing research on the galaxy s   i wanted to get the best card possible that had decent capacity     gb or greater   this led me to find that the galaxy s  supports the microsdxc class    uhs i card  which is the fastest possible given that class  searching for that specifically on amazon gave me results of only   vendors  as of april  that makes these microsdxc class    uhs   cards  they are sandisk  the majority   samsung and lexar  nobody else makes these that are sold on amazon seeing how sandisk is a pretty good name out of the    i ve used them the most   i decided upon the sandisk because lexar was overpriced and the samsung one was overpriced  as well as not eligible for amazon prime  but the scary thing is that when you filter by the sandisk  you literally get dozens of options  all of them have different model numbers  different sizes  etc  then there s that confusion of what s the difference between sdhc   sdxc sdhc vs sdxc sdhc stand for  secure digital high capacity  and sdxc stands for  secure digital extended capacity   essentially these two cards are the same with the exception that sdhc only supports capcities up to   gb and is formated with the fat   file system  the sdxc cards are formatted with the exfat file system  if you use an sdxc card in a device  it must support that file system  otherwise it may not be recognizable and or you have to reformat the card to fat   fat   vs exfat the differences between the two file systems means that fat   has a maximum file size of  gb  limited by that file system  exfat on the otherhand  supports file sizes up to  tb  terabytes   the only thing you need to know here really is that it s possible your device doesn t support exfat  if that s the case  just reformat it to fat    remember formatting erases all data to clarify the model numbers  i i hopped over to the sandisk official webpage  what i found there is that they offer two  highspeed  options for sandisk cards  these are sandisk extreme pro and sandisk ultra  sandisk extreme pro is a line that supports read speeds up to   mb sec  however they are sdhc only  to make things worse  they are currently only available in   gb    gb capacities  since one of my requirements was to have a lot of storage  i ruled these out the remaining devices listed on amazon s search were the sandisk ultra line  but here  confusion sets in because sandisk separates these cards to two different devices  cameras   mobile devices  is there a real difference between the two or is this just a marketing stunt  unfortunately i m not sure but i do know the price difference between the two range from a couple cents to a few dollars  since i wasn t sure  i opted for the one specifically targeted for mobile devices  just in case there is some kind of compatibility issue   to find the exact model number  i would go to sandisk s webpage  sandisk com  and compare their existing product lineup  from there  you get exact model numbers and you can then search amazon for these model numbers  that is how i got mine  sdsdqua    g  as for speed tests  i haven t run any specific testing  but copying   gb worth of data from my pc to the card literally took just a few minutes one last note is that amazon attaches additional characters to the end  for example sdsdqua    g affp a vs sdsdqua    g u  a   the difference between the two is that the  affp a  means  amazon frustration free packaging   other than that  these are exactly the same   if you re wondering what i got  and want to use it in your galaxy s    i got the sdsdqua    g u  a and it works like charm \n",
      "i inserted this little gem in to my new nook hd and let me tell you    wow   she loves it so much and she won t give it back   instead of buying larger capacity tablets    just buy the smallest amount of gigs and buy one of these little dudes \n",

      "i purchased this for my go pro hero      its a solid card  but unless your planning to buy several i would recommended going with the    gig  at the higher capture setting you can only get a little over an hour or so of video time \n",
      "a standard when it comes to high capacity mobile memory   grated  if you have an older android phone  or older tablet  you probably won t see much difference   but if you have a modern device like a galaxy s   or note    or equivalent mobile device  you ll definitely notice the difference in data transfer and access in your device   for modern phones  a uhs   memory card is a must   the only reason i didn t give this product five stars is because it s not a sandisk extreme  or a sandisk extreme pro   but then again  you must have extremely specific needs to want to get   mb s transfer speeds on a mobile device   for movies  music and apps  this one is more that adequate \n",

      "no question  it is really as fast as it s rated  how fast  well  class         sdhc      means literally sd format  hc high capacity  class        mb sec read write  how fast is   mb per second  well  class    the most common step down  i e  cheaper  is class    i e   mb sec  so class    is     times faster  why pay the difference digital cameras  at some point the number of pictures sec or hd video is bottle necked by the speed of the media it is being recorded to smart phones  i have a samsung note ii  a quad core processor  wiz bang yadda yadda  yes  i do notice speed differences in camera  app performance  i use a spreadsheet app browser netflix music streaming  et al  is noticeably faster  where do you think the phone stores stuff to when it doesn t use the factory installed memory   iphomes don t have an sd slot  and i wouldn t own a phone or tablet that doesn t    i believe in choice in the computer realm oh yeah  sandisk is a leader and pioneer in the sd format  where do you think the  sd  came from    the only other sdhc class    card worthy of comparison is the samsung brand  but then i might be biased on that one \n",

      "i have to assume that the brand new   gb sandisk ultra class    sdxc card is responsible for the occasional video recording stutter pausing that has happened since i started using it today   prior to that  never had an issue with my previous sandisk sdhc card   but today on its maiden trip  it has led each video  only     minutes long each  to have several performance issues that by default i have to attribute to the card since nothing else has changed and i ve never had an issue in the four months that i ve had my galaxy note     no problems formatting this card though or installing using it otherwise \n",

      "this works well in my galaxy s   i use it for media storage  i did have to reseat it once as i kept getting an error about  preparing sd card   but i think that was more about how i put it in my phone than about this media  i think that this is a pretty good value to extend storage on a phone update   i deducted a star because this card has a capacity of    billion bytes  but not    gb  there is a difference  the storage is actually around    gb because                                            gb  it s still a very good value and i would still recommend it highly  but do understand that you are not getting    gb \n",

      "i first tried putting it in my camera  without formatting   it just said      insert another card        i put it into my linux computer  and it output lots of errors in the syslog  and fsck wouldn t work at all  just error ed out  so i couldn t even format it my windows computer couldn t recognize it either  though it tried to format it   my phone didn t give any errors  but i wasn t able to really test it there    i do wonder if just the mini to standard adapter is the problem  since my phone has a mini slot  and everywhere else that i tried it needed the adapter   exchanging for a different brand  and i ll see what happens \n",
      "as stated above  and not a bad price   bought this thing in hopes of using it with my ztpad c   tablet  and it works like a charm   the card is very fast for what it is and i have not had any problems with it to date \n",

      "after having my first ever failure of a sd card  a   gb sandisk micro sd card that went from apparently fine to totally corrupted in a matter of minutes  and before i could salvage anything on it  with the refund from amazon of the    gb card i purchased this   gb ultra card as the replacement for my phone after having problems getting the full    gb seen as an individual    gb and not a partitioned into two    gb files on the card  and the secret is to not format the card in a computer  format the card in the phone  then via usb or wifi you can add back all the content it is seemingly working great  seems fast with no undo lag when taking burst mode photos and i just hope it will continue to do so  i am much more contentious about backing up though  with android  amazon and google pretty much all your content can be saved online and reinstalled but it takes time and is a big hassle so just backing up to a computer works great for the next  just in case  time \n",
      "first off  companies need to mark these right  they consider     mb to be   gig  when   gig is actually      mb that means you will end up with    gb       and in all actuality it will read as    gb in your device      other then that this card works awesome  i would highly recommend it one star lost due to them not knowing how to measure data \n",

      "i upgraded a generic  small micro sd card i had on hand and was using in my gs    this card is very fast making for seamless read and write of pictures  video and playback of music stored on the sd card   it works great which is exactly what i have come to expect from all sandisk products \n",

      "i dont understand why but i use both micro sd cards and usb and these always seem to work better and last longer \n",
      "i ve had the card for a month now  and it has given me no issues  the transfer speed is quite good  moving data from my old class   device to this new one was arduous only due to the slower  older device  any new material that i have to transfer to the phone zips along very fast now i have just that much more room for movies and music  which is exactly what i needed \n",
      "i bought this for my surface pro     gb  so now i have an additional    gb which i use for movies and music etc so i don t use up my     gb ssd for that stuff  works great \n",

      "i thought buying this directly from amazon would guarantee me an  authentic  sandisk   honestly  i m not sure if i got an  authentic  one or not  but it s failed within   months   either it s not authentic or sandisk has really dropped the ball on quality   p s  it s made in china   if that tells you anything \n",
      "this is a very fast and reliable microsd card   i used this on my galaxy note   and loaded movies and family pictures   transfer time is speedy \n",
      "sadly i missed the return window by a couple of days   this card got flaky in my galaxy note    a little google research and it appears this is a very well known and widespread issue with these class      gb cards   avoid until it s fixed \n",
      "i have this in my phone  i use it for music and videos transfer speeds from my computer to the card are pretty speedy it works great \n",
      "always can trust sandisk for my memory card needs   this purchase was because i was considering getting a samsung galaxy s  phone  which only has   gb memory  but has an internal slot for memory expansion   however  just had several bad experiences with   samsung printers at work   all of them broke down within a couple of weeks of each other for various reasons  and to get repair and replacement parts is ridiculously expensive     cheaper for me to go and buy a new printer   samsung website is       useless  and tech support is even less knowledgeable than my   year old nephew   spoke to a good friend who works for at t   who has both s  and iphone       and he said  dont get the s      so i upgraded to an   gb iphone   so this memory card has gone to my son for his galaxy s  so sorry about the rant  but i hate samsung     \n",
      "arrived today  as always shipping from amazon is the best i read the reviews  and decided i would give the sandisk   gb microsdxc a shot  normally i go with patriot for all my flash memory so one thing i read that worried me  was the heat issue  well i can say that it does run hot how hot you ask  i can feel it through the back cover of my samsung galaxy s   not plastic melting hot  but i know it is there is that an issue  maybe  maybe not  i have never really noticed any of my previous cards getting hot  sure even some of my usb sticks run hot after a transfer is it cause for concern  i honestly don t know  yet i will use it and see if heat causes any issues  if anyone has had the same problem feel free to comment and tell me what happened or if you contacted sandisk i am thinking about calling them and also samsung to find out what max temperature range is acceptable  as i really don t want to ruin my bad a   new phone otherwise this is a lot of space for cheap  can t complain there  i gave it   stars for that reason alone the heat issue is something else and i wont take a star off just because of that but i will still be concerned until i have some answers thanks for reading \n",
      "great price and holds tons of stuff  the class    is way faster then any other card i have purchased\n",
      "despite the class    rating  this card has much slower write speeds than some others and there are numerous examples online of it not being fast enough to work with the high resolution video from the gopro hero   black edition  if you re using that camera  choose one of the cards recommended on their site \n",
      "i bought two of these for use in my hero cam  i ve had no problem with these and the video picture quality is right on  this is a good value \n",
      "this died so fast and i barely used it   in fact  i did not even put anything on it and it died   my pad recognized it for a few weeks  but when i went to put stuff on it  it was dead complete garbage  stay away \n",
      "larger than move and was a high class i use this on my s  and works wonderfully i store all images on sd take quck second to load but much faster and better than the last sd card i had which was a class  \n",
      "i bought this card for my galaxy s   but with the included adapter i can also use it in my canon  d in a pinch  as it meets uhs   spec it can keep up with the cameras buffer there are plenty of details in these reviews regarding transfer rates  etc so i won t revisit that  i have had no issues with the card overheating  it performs exactly as i expected  the price was also fantastic i would recommend this card to anyone for a wide variety of reasons  it is fast  has a good warranty and comes with the adapter to use in regular sized sd card slots \n",
      "picked this up for my sport action camera and it s just what i needed  class    and the speeds match up with the rating  came with a sd card adapter which was a nice bonus  been using it for almost   months now with formatting after each filming  no lag on any of the video  no problems with card  running strong \n",
      "i couldn t put any files onto the card that were        gb  a little disappointing since i wanted to store movies on it  but i guess it s a limitation of the microsd hc technology \n",
      "great value for the price   comes with an adaptor so it can be used in multiple types of devices   i have had no issues with it and would recommend it \n",
      "i got this so i made sure my new smart phone had enough storage  i  unknowingly  got the phone with a ton of space but this was an awesome addition to the phone and how much i ve been able to store on it  highly recommended \n",

      "it has work great     i have used it a lot iun my smartphone to storage photos music and game roms    works perfect\n",
      "i have an asus tf      gb  and i just plugged it right in and it worked without a flaw  the only annoying things  the card may get stuck in the sd adapter  so you might want to be careful with that  other than that its great  shipped on time  great prices  these are regularly like     to     \n",
      "this was a good investment for my galaxy note    i had to use the perseus kernel to swap the internal memory with this little guy  so right now  my phone reports internal memory of   gb  so that s great  it s good saving pictures  full hd videos  games  etc \n",

      "i was a bit skeptical about getting this card because the official instructions for this phone only mention that the external memory is expandable up to   gb  i did a bit of research before purchasing   many reported being able to use this card with the evo  g lte  i can confirm that it works at first  the phone won t recognize the card  you need to format the card when you first install it  once you format the card  the phone will recognize it   you can write   read data with no issues i got such a large card because of music  i wanted to add music in  wav format for better audio quality  or at least in mp     kbs   i m very happy with this card \n",

      "ok  this won t be a technical review or a rating of measured speeds  it is simply a review from a consumer point of view  i have bought a couple of these microsdxc memory cards for tablets  and have seen no lag in saving data  i also use them for digital cameras  and have been very happy with the record time   it s instant  you can get into the mb s on various cards  but usually  the difference is not something that anyone would notice or see  for the price  this is an excellent memory card  and i would highly recommend it \n",
      "i was using mine in a gopro hero     the card just broke for no reason   there is controversy weather its the gopro or sandisk  but after doing some google research it seems that its more of sandisk s fault as these sd cards also fail  or used to  in varies samsung devices  phones   tablets    amazon sent me a replacement  so no harm done  but for the money you would expect something top notch gopro users  on the support forums  recommend getting  x  gb sd cards  which have not had any issues as far as anyone knows   the worst part is losing important content  i was lucky  i copied my movies from the sd card onto a hd on my pc   others not so lucky \n",

      "works great and price was not too bad either  worked perfect with out having to format it  transfer rate was fast when i loaded    movies and   gb of musice and   gb of pictures all at the same time  it took a total of    min  probably because i had multiple transfers at same time but works great for my new bought samsung galaxy note       thanks\n",

      "with this card i picked up for     amazon s black friday sale  i increased my gnii s storage to   gb  it transfers data at about   mb read write  which is well below advertised  however  this is very similar to the speed that my gnii s built in storage transfers data at  so when running large applications off of this sd card i see no difference in speed than running apps off of the phone itself \n",
      "nothing interesting to write  it works just fine and holds a lot of info for such a little card  thanks \n",

      "i had been using a  regular  sandisk   gb micro sd card that came included with my htc thunderbolt i bought in       the size was decent  but i never realized until upgrading how much i was lacking on the speed i finally got one of these to replace my old card with my galaxy s   it is superb  i just recently got a galaxy s   and again  this card is just about the best expansion you can add to most any phone with my old microsd card  i had gotten used to just sitting there  zoning out  as i waited patiently for my computer to transfer pictures videos off my card to be backed up to my pc s hard drive  or copying some music files from my pc to my card  with this new card  almost any single file  even hundreds of megabytes big  is an instant transfer  that transfers too quick to even bring up that      moving      dialog box in windows    on my very big transfers  lots of hd video files at once  totaling several gigabytes   i have to wait  but i m waiting for seconds instead of minutes combine the excellent speed with the fact that   gb can hold a ton of data  compared to typical storage sizes on phones   and you have a very satisfied customer  now i can procrastinate even longer the occasional transfers of all my pictures and videos to my pc  though i try not to a lot of phones  like my s   specify   gb sdxc cards as the maximum they support  so this is about the best you can even get for the moment  unless you want to pay almost double for sandisk s extreme cards  unless you have money to burn  i think these are a much better value and diminishing returns certainly kick in beyond this price point  but perhaps my next phone will support  k hd video onto    gb cards and i will yet again need to upgrade my card s capacity and speed    anyway  bottom line on this product  awesome \n",
      "bought this a few months back for my phone    but after switching phones to one that didn t support extra storage i reformatted and stuck it on my car stereo full of music  even at full capacity it has been there for months now playing without a hitch  music only take about   seconds after starting the car to start playing  skipping  fast forwarding or searching all works flawlessly  the stereo is to be given some props here but if the card wasn t up to par it clearly wouldn t be as fast as it is  very glad with the purchase  will buy again if the need ever comes \n",
      "with technology improving upon solid state memory extremely quickly  there s no excuse to buy the best in speed  without sacrificing quality many   gb cards are class      which makes them very slow  if you re going to be utilizing   gb of data for photos videos  your phone or just super small storage  you re much better off purchasing a faster card such as this  the price is right  and even if it s a little more expensive than the class     or even   s  you will regret having pinched a few dollars instead of investing into faster speeds i currently use this in my sony action cam  and the write speed works perfectly for me  as well as the reading speed to transfer files off the card \n",
      "i used this to turn my nook color into an android   it was incredibly easy to install and works great   i haven t had any problems with it   the read and write speeds are phenomenal  given that i am running an entire operating system off just this card   the price was great too \n",

      "i ended up with two of these after mistakenly purchasing the regular sized sd cards for hikvision security cameras only to find that they needed the micro sd cards instead   they installed and formatted with no issues and are working well in the cameras the best thing about sandisk is that they have a lifetime warranty with these cards unlike some of the other brands i purchased these for    dollars each and are reasonably priced around that \n",
      "i bought this class    sd card for my gopro   black and it works great  i only recorded with     p   fps with protunes and never had any problems  in the past in my gopro hero  it was very picky with the sd card that you use  but so far this card works great  i do not trust the transfer speed test because there are so many factors that change the outcome  card reader  usb version  hard drives  and etc  \n",
      "i use this in my dell venue   tablet  i have loaded it up with movies  mp   s  and they playback flawlessly  however if it try to add a very large movie   gb   my windows   machine says that it is too large for the destination format  i shrink them down when that happens  again  i am very happy with this purchase  just wanted to point out a small limitation \n",

      "good product  it arrived extremely fast and performs just as described  it was considerably cheaper than any other store i found  i specially like the speed of this sd card  however do keep in mind that the speeds tend to be exaggerated  the speeds are way faster than normal sd card speeds and you will notice it  but not anywhere close to whats advertised  there a lot of factor that go in to consideration when it comes to the advertised speed  this is not the manufacture or seller fault  but it depends on the system that is being used \n",
      "got two of these   one for our samsung galaxy note      tablet and one for my samsung galaxy note ii cell phone   both devices had no problem recognizing the new   gb cards   couldn t be any easier to use   nice to have a large amount of storage on both devices   the easy to open packaging was a real treat   i did not use the adapters as i just connect my phone and tablet to my laptop via usb to transfer music  photos and music \n",

      "i bought this with the sole intention of putting it in my samsung galaxy s   i had to use a tool to format the card to fat    but once i did so  the card worked great  i have been taking advantage of the extra room i have for music  videos  pictures  etc  the sd adapter that comes with this is also handy the transfer speeds didn t feel like class    when connected and transferred files from my computer  but my computer is   years old  so it s very possible that it s the problem  other than that  i m completely satisfied \n",

      "i purchased the card in the sandisk packaging  so i am pretty sure it is genuine  i tested it with various programs on the web that apparently can detect whether they are fakes or not  this one turned out to be a real sandisk card  the card came formatted with fat   i read on the web about these micro sds  and apparently they are not as fast as the full sd card version  i borrowed my brothers sandisk   gb full sd card to make comparison tests  here are my official unofficial test results using diskbench v        and h testw     test  i will give the results as an  overall  result  because after testing these cards over and over with speed writes and reads  the results get mixed and varied to a big degree    much larger than i expected  but the numerous tests showed me a  general  trend  the trend is that the full sd cards do write faster than the microsd card  but  also remember that the microsd had to be put into an adapter to do the test on my pc while the fullsd card was put into the computer reader directly these are just my averages  but small file writes both sd cards wrote at close to   mb sec  the microsd was less consistent in the tests and sometimes dropped to  mb sec small file reads both sd cards read at close to    mb sec at their fastest large file copies to card microsd wrote at    mb sec while the fullsd wrote at about  mb seclarge file reads copies from card microsd was   mb sec while the fullsd read at about   mb sec my conclusion my tests were by no means official for this card and showed much variance dependent on file size of the reads and writes  but the fullsd card was faster in many cases  but equal to microsd in most cases  the small file writes and reads showed that they are similar enough  but  my only concern is with large file writes     is     mb sec good enough for rapid photography on a high pixel camera  i don t know  i have had no problem using these cards with h    movie capture for hours  i am surprised that     mb sec is enough also  never during the huge file copies to the card did i get any noticeable heating of the card itself  by touch even for an hour  i ve noticed that it has been a complaint from many people on the web  some stating that they felt they might burn themselves  i copied files that took more than an hour with no noticeable temperature change  other than  perhaps a couple of degrees  of course  this was on a pc and not installed in a camera the card performs well for video work  and appears to meet many other tests performed by other people  i never saw a read close to    mb sec    they were very consistent at    mb sec at the highest performance i would get the card again  if the price were right \n",

      "i searched for an inexpensive    gb micosdxc card for my new samsung galaxy note           edition    gb  tablet and this one caught my eyes regarding positive comments and price  the note was a christmas gift and it will be used for media entertainment while on business travel and as a replacement for an aging toshiba notebook  there were no problems with the install     the card was recognized upon boot up after the installation  i don t require great transfer speeds for my tasks  a quick test using es file explorer copying a     mb media file from the tablet os card to this expansion card yielded    mb s write and     mb s read speed  which is more than sufficient for all my tasks  as a bonus  i added this card to my shopping cart at        and the following day the price dropped to         that was all the incentive needed to push the      place your order      button  i can t speak much of reliability since i ve had the card installed for less than two weeks  so far it has been stable \n",
      "excellent product  high capacity  well made   holds many pics  movies  and music   a gift to the camera buff   i ve always wanted a hi capacity item by sandisk \n",
      "i got this card only a few months ago  used it on a note    now it has failed  no matter what i try  attempts to format the drive or edit the files on it  whether using my computer or the phone  have all failed  the card s data is now essentially read only  which is the only saving grace of this since i could at least save my data previous to this i had an issue with it corrupting photos randomly  with increasing regularity as it grew closer to complete failure  i am now going to be avoiding sandisk when possible\n",
      "i bought this for my lumia      windows phone to supplement the onboard storage capacity  fits fine  works great  fast access  immediately recognized by the device  not much more you can ask of a microsd card \n",

      "good fast and inexpensive microsd   noticeably faster for most tasks than the class   s that are hanging around  so useful for when you don t have access to your cloud storage \n",
      "not much to say about this except it works great   the r w speed never seems to slow down photo or movie taking      gb doubled the capacity of my tablet so i won t reach the capacity for a long time \n",
      "this   gb microsdhc card replaces a   gb card   ordering was easy  the price was good and the product arrived well packaged and fully functional \n",

      "over the years  i ve found sandisk memory to be durable and reliable  this    gb class    card appears to be no exception  so far  it s performed well  i especially appreciate the fast write speed  for the money  it s a good deal \n",
      "i m still stuck    years ago when microsd cards were fairly new  they were and still are neat   its amazing at how much you can put on something that is literally the size of a fingernail  i purchased this class      gig exclusively for use with mygopro hero   black editionso that the card can keep up when the camera is recording hd at   fps  its amazing how many people aren t aware of the classes of these data cards and how it can affect performance and capturing of video and even stills  if you have tried capturing video only for it to shut off automatically  it may be because your memory isn t fast enough to keep up  but you ll have no problems keeping up with this card nor should you have problems storing it all  this sandisk memory often gets labeled  the best of the cheap memory  but i m unsure how the expensive  poor memory does   why would anyone buy anything else more expensive   this is the card to get  it s so good  i ve also purchase two   gig cards for our samsung s  s \n",

      "i have two of these that i am using with a gopro hero  and they work great  i will be getting more     while i could do the   gb  i  so far  am preferring the   gb  because the card is about full right when a battery reaches the end of it s life so i can swap a card and battery at the same time and save opening closing the case and swapping parts all of the time   the card is plenty fast  never had any hiccups with that and they have proven to be quite reliable as i have a  rd card that i have been using in multiple mobile phones  htc and bb  since      and have never had any problem at all with any of them \n",
      "using it in a         android tablet and have had no issues  mounted easily and seems to be doing it s job \n",
      "it works as expected  i use one of these on my samsung galaxy s  and another on my asus transformer  no problems so far \n",
      "it works as described  i bought    one for me and one for my wife s tablet  i love amazon and the ease of purchasing with super fast shipping  item came in retail packaging that is hard to remove  they have to do this in stores to prevent theft  just use scissors  you ll get it out eventually  it shows       gigs when installed but this is typical for sd cards  download the sandisc memory zone app to see how fast a card you need before you purchase one  it tells you exactly what you need and may save you a few bucks \n",
      "it is hard to believe that   gb is now the same size as your pinky finger nail   no complaints  i use it in my lg phone and its plenty fast enough for anything\n",

      "this was immediately recognized by my windows     laptop  i had to re format this from exfat to fat   in order to have it be recognized by my samsung note   and my        android tablet it took a long time to transfer    gb of video files from laptop ssd hard drive over to the sdxc card  i imagined that it would happen more quickly     but it did work smoothly overall  this is what i wanted and it was a great deal for the price \n",

      "so far  so good   it does what it s supposed to do   doesn t seem any faster or slower than any other micro sd card i had   bought a cheap imitation on ebay and regretted it as it crashed   it really doesn t pay to be cheap with memory   it s all about the reliability  which you get with this product       update   big problem with this sd card if you are a windows phone user   does not properly record hd video   video recording to sd card is consistently choppy   pop in another sd card   records fine   record to my phone   records fine   i ve tried formatting it every which way and it isn t working well   go with another brand windows phone users \n",

      "the price alone makes this product well worth it and being a class    and not having to pay a lot to get a quality disk is rare which is why i choose to order from amazon\n",
      "plug and play simplicity  popped it in and it works  didn t even need to format it  i believe sandisk said it was formatted as  exfat  so i m good with that and so is my wife s phone  it shows approximately    gb before use  holds a whole heap of photos and videos \n",

      "sandisk chips are pretty good but relatively expensive at times you d think that online prices would be more affordable  it can be but you can not tell if the seller is selling a fake product ot not the one i received was genuine  any of sandisk products can be returned and exchanged for another if genuine so i ve not had a problem in exchanges with the company   knocks on wood   the   gb version works well with android tablets but not the   gb versions so beware  i did read online at other forums that the   gb version works relatively well  though  with android phones  which is weird why would it work on the smartphone but not the tablet prices have dropped so it may have come down in prices at local retail stores so do shop around \n",

      "i noticed amazon had the  ultra  version for only a couple bucks more than the standard black version  and this one comes with an sd adapter in case i ever need it  i haven t bothered to speed test it since i m using it for the tablet and don t feel like removing it from the tablet just for a test   but seems fast enough from my experience so far  definitely faster than the regular black sandisk cards from my experience with sandisk products  their read write speeds are much faster than they claim in their conservative estimates  it s not worth messing with their standard line if you can get  ultra    extreme   or  pro  for not much more \n",
      "i put this in my nokia lumia     and so far it works really well  i put my entire itunes library on my phone and it all wrote on the card i believe in under an hour  i didn t keep track  my only regret is i probably should have purchased the   gb card \n",

      "my review is a little backwards        but i thought the most relevant should go first warning  only buy this card on sale the  typical  price since summer      is about     for    gb  and about     for    gb   do not pay any more than this  and you can actually pay less if you have the luxury of time   patience the lowest  non lightning  price hit about        for   gb and     for   gb  in early december   i basically buy when the price hits     or less  and the    nears        from december      to january       i watched these cards change price on an almost daily basis   they initially went on sale for about        and        for    and    respectively   i watched them slowly increase in price  with random dips and peaks for a month   on january  th       they still show as a      best deal on amazon      for        more days      but they are at the highest price point since last summer    and higher than i have  ever  payed for these cards   so don t let the      best deals      section deceive you  at          these are not a      deal      in terms of price okay  here s my actual      review      of these absolutely great sdxc cards     i have tried a variety of microsdxc cards  and so far the samsung ultra uhs  are the best    and the price can t be beat    for all the most important reasons  speed  capacity  reliability  durability i have not had a single failure  and i use these cards in my nook hd   nexus         via usb  and my canon  d mark ii  with converter  and macbook pro  in the card slot    they re durable and waterproof  and  i can use the same card in all these devices without reformatting   i even had one go through the wash  and i still use it for pictures for the technically inclined  i have cards with  both  the clockwork mod bootloader  for the nook hd   and the magiclantern firmware for my canon eos  d ii on the same card   i can pull it from the nook  shoot pictures with the camera  and look at the results on the nook by just pulling the card out of one device and placing it in the other   this should be possible with any sdxc sdhc card  but it turns out that the samsung uhs  is the only card i ve found that works reliably   some cards won t boot because they re too slow too finicky  but all my samsung uhs s work great  the   gb will not boot in the nook  but no   gb card will  i keep my eyes open for price drops on these cards because they ve performed so well for me   samsung also has a newer  faster card  but its price point hovers somewhere north of      prohibitive      so i still stick with these   and that s good news regardless because as the new card increases its market share  these should drop even further in price \n",
      "maybe i got a defective card but this one felt a bit      thinner      and      flimsier      than other micro sd cards i ve had the real problem was after a week of use as expanded storage in a tablet  i started having trouble with certain programs installed on the card  then finally the tablet gave me a message that the card was corrupt  and while a pc would recognize it  eery time i tried to format the card  there would be an error \n",

      "  stars for the excellent price and performance  seems to be as advertised  average copying speeds are around      mb s only gripe is that sandisk doesn t include any extras   i e  a plastic protective case  or bundle it with a sd card reader  however  can understand why at this price point \n",
      "the primary reason for buying this extra capacitysandisk ultra    gb microsdxc class   card was to use it insamsung galaxy tab         inch model gt p     and i am happy to share that you can get this to work flawlessly after some initial glitches   read below firstly you need to be aware that the samsung tablet model gt p     currently runs with android os       with kernel               and build number jro  c p    ueclk   jelly bean  my experiences shared here are with that level of android os your experiences may vary depending on what version of os you are running  the sandisk ultra    gb microsdxc card purchased from amazon  retail packaging  gets recognized just fine however when the tablet s media device a k a  mtp  application attempts to talk your pc via usb cable the tablet simply reboots  and after that the card is presented to the pc    really strange indeed this baffled me for couple of hours  firstly  i attempted to format the card  exfat  in pc and it formatted just fine  after that i attempted to use it in the tablet to see the same behavioral oddity of instantaneous reboot of the tablet as  mtp  application tries to communicate with the pc  this made me investigate the issue further and i determined the root cause was the fact that sandisk now seen to factory format the card with  exfat  but also somehow seen to include an  offset  of   mb at the beginning of the card which shows up as   mb unallocated region in the initial sectors on this card under windows disk management tool the solution is to get rid of that  unallocated    mb partition on the card  you could do it in pc but that might require some windows command line experience and using  diskpart  utility and what not and i do not want to confuse people here with that process  for most novice users the process should be very simple  just insert the card on the tablet and use the  native  sd card format tool under  settings  that android os       has and it will get rid of that   mb partition and happily remount it  now after this simple process the  mtp  application works just fine with pc to transfer files to the sd card without any strange reboot phenomenon not sure why sandisk formats their class    card in this fashion  they never did it with their class   cards earlier  and there s gotta be some technical explanation for why they include that   mb partition that only sandisk can give  in the end if you reformat the card in the tablet  which defaults to exfat  the card is seen to work just fine bottomline            this is an awesome   gb capacity microsd card from a reputed manufacturer for budget minded people and gets the job done beautifully  the read and write speeds are adequate enough for most audio video   picture file formats in a tablet  the glitch mentioned above forced me to give  four  stars instead of  five  stars but let that not stop you from making a decision to buy it highly recommended cheers \n",
      "i purchased this because my samsumg galaxy s  was getting full of pictures  it installed easy  works great and i have had no speed issues when writing or reading from it \n",
      "i ve had this memory card in my s  for the past few months without any issues  the only problem i ve had with this was when i initially copied the   gb of data from my old card to this card  i had this connected to my laptop using a microsd usb adapter and the copies kept failing  i figured out that the card was overheating when writing a lot of data  i was able to copy the data by pointing a small desk fan towards the card adapter during the file copy process  that being said  i don t have any read write problems due to overheating with the card installed in my phone  i ve copied over a couple of gigs of movies to watch on some trips with the card installed in the phone without any failures  it may be that heat issue only occurs after pushing       gb of data at a time  the largest movie i copied to the phone was  gb  most of the other movies are just over a gig the only prep work for use in my phone was the initial format when it was first installed  the card was recognized prior to the formatting but i had seen where others had read write issues so the format was a preemptive move \n",
      "i don t have too much to say about an sd card  but i wanted to at least give it the   stars it deserves  we used it in a galaxy s  and it has worked flawlessly so far  i haven t  run any benchmarks to confirm the speed  etc but it does not seem to hinder the phone or camera  which we now have saving photos videos to the sd card  in any way i will point out the the s  camera app did notify us that burst mode shots will still write to the phone s internal memory  potentially due to the high date of data being written  that s good to know if you use burst mode a lot and were hoping to use an sd card for that purpose \n",
      "came quick and works well with my galaxy s   formating was simple  its a sandisk not much that could be wrong with it \n",
      "full disclosure  i use no other brand of sd card other than sandiskhaving said that  i was pleased to discover an sd card designed for people who demand fast transfer speeds for hd video applications  i purchased this item for my tablet pc and have been pleased with its functionality  the adapter is great for accessing via computer to transfer files directly if usb is not desired \n",
      "it s been working for over   years on my gp camera   has not crashed nor failed me   i ve shot over a hundred hours of footage on this card   i will buy again for sure \n",
      "performs as expected  i bought for mi galaxy s  to increase it storage options  when i need to transfer big files i use a usb adapter since the wifi and mtp conectios speed is far slower than directly connecting the device but that is not the cards problem  its fast reading and writing inside the s  and when connected to a current generation computer old computers will read and write at slower speeds  but is still compatible hardware wise  the exfat format can be a hassle no problems yet hardware wise  i would have preferred an open standard as partition format instead of exfat  but that is microsoft fault not sandisk is easy to reformat with a usb sd micro sd adapter \n",
      "works well with my dslr  have never been able to fill it  i guess   gb would be enough for average use  go for faster speeds and smaller size \n",
      "use it  with the included adapter  as a spare card for my panasonic fz    lumix camera and as a quick and easy temporary backup drive for my macbook pro laptop  which has a standard sd slot   also use it to make a quick transfer of files between the laptop and an imac  works exactly like a full size sd card for these purposes  very fast and reliable data transfers  and the special price from amazon made these cards less costly than the standard    gb card at the time update  i have changed the star rating from a   to a    this micro card worked fine for about three months and then suddenly began to disappear from the laptop finder  it still shows up and works fine when mounted in the desktop imac  but often it will not mount in the laptop  this could be a problem with the laptop and if that turns out to be the case  i will restore this to a   star rating \n",
      "pretty much as stated above   write rate holds up well from small files to large files   reads vary from      mb sec but holds pretty steadily via card reader  in supplied sd adapter   through motorola photon q  and through the sandisk sddr     a  m adapter via usb     and on either pc i have\n",
      "i needed more storage for my venue   pro tablet  plugged it in and was able to store large files on it within minutes  so far so good \n",
      "this was a great deal that i would purchase again if i need another just like it  my galaxy note   is great for videos  games and movies so it needs a lot of storage  this sandisk had just the right amount of gbs and price to make this a great deal  it s almost filled up already so i might buy another one soon  don t hesitate if you re interested in quality storage \n",

      "this   gb card is fast   great for storing video and music and whatever you need to do without worry   it is plenty large and the price is very reasonable \n",

      "and good product   i haven t had any issue with the san disk memory cards so i prefer to stay with them   i have several electronic devices what use the micro sd and they all work great   i would recommend this product \n",
      "first off  i ve always bought sandisk for the warranty under the reasoning that a lifetime warranty means they must be a little better than the others and sandisk s lesser lines  i have   class   sd  gb extreme iii series cards all pushing   years old now with zero problems  all of which write nearly twice as fast  not sure what the limitation is  class    uhs    and   year newer tech should blow these away   the  micro  packaging shouldn t make a difference either   i can only guess it s marketing differentiation again this card will write at published specs but you may want to check out the sony sr  uya tqmn of the same capacity  it reads and writes faster and is a similar price  though only a one year warranty  i picked it up with a hisense   pro tablet  awesome  and couldn t wait  and they were on sale locally for      was a pleasant surprise  came with a sd adapter as well and some file recovery software  a link    not a fan of sony web sites support or or documentation for any of their gear the last    years but these are commodities now i suppose and you can t expect much any longer  i now kind of think if these things work    days  they ll probably work      years until they are obsolete  fyi the sandisk and sony are both made in china \n",
      "i was pleasantly surprised that my card arrived ahead of schedule  that s always a plus in my book  the works without a hitch  i was able to copy the files from my   gb card to this one relatively quickly and very easily  my samsung galaxy tab       read the card perfectly  i have no complaints about the card although i expected the write speed to be a little faster  after all is said and done i would definitely recommend this card for your tablet  smart phone  or any other device that allows for expandable memory \n",
      "decent transfer speeds out of phone  in phone sees around      mb s down to    this card is nothing to write home about however  as it only lasted me   months  now it will not read in my phone or laptop or friend s phone  so now i lost all my files    i recommend you store your vital files in the phone \n",
      "the card does all it promises to do  but i have a gripe  the nail ridge near the outer end of the card is not defined enough  which makes it rather difficult to extract the card from a reader or adapter this is the first microsd card i have that has had this problem \n",

      "if you need a memory card  this one works as advertised    it is fast and reliable   i have never had a problem with this brand \n",

      "nice to see name brand things that are cheaper then in the store   i bought this either for my phone or tablet   you never need to worry about running out of space   the only downside to this is if you have big fingers this thing is small and hard to manipulate for it to go in the proper way and space \n",
      "what more can i say  they always work for me  at one time  they were more expensive than other brands  if you look for deals  that is no longer true \n",
      "i wanted a good quality micro sd for video recording my nephew s wedding   this was more than enough storage for a couple hours of mixed    p and     p recording with plenty of room to spare   video looked good for the quality of video cam \n",

      "fast and very easy to use   works with my gs  and it is comparable with other devices   want to buy the    gb one \n",
      "i ve had this card for a couple months now and it is amazing  i use it in my phone so i can put stuff in there rather then use the space on the phone  its extremely responsive and extremely  fast as well  i had a sandisk class   microsd card and this flies past that easily  usually when i would try playing music it would take a couple seconds to start  but using this it starts instantaneous   it was as if i had stored the music on the phone itself  i dont know what else you might use this card for  but if you are looking for a microsd for your phone  look no further\n",
      "unless your really stringent on form factor  and negligible speed  always get these with the adapter  some phones do not transfer data that quickly and the adapter is a life saver  always have it in my pc when dumping large files  speed is actually a big improvement over the   gb card \n",
      "i have found this chip works well even in conditions that aren t ideal  i bought a   gb galaxy s   and tried this chip but the phone has a flaw with the   gb microsoft chips so it worked for a month then would randomly eject the card when i didn t do anything \n",
      "i have a long term positive experience using sandisk cards  i have been very pleased with the way these cards work in my samsung galaxy note      no problems whatsoever and the capacity is huge i quickly became confused about the differences between the so called      mobile      ultra cards and the ultra cards  the performance specs to my      intermediate tech experience      eyes were virtually the same  the prices were also similar  with the      mobile     version slightly higher  to finally resolve my confusion i contacted sandisk technical support  to my surprise  the      mobile      version is the older  no longer manufactured version  the ultra is the current model  so i immediately bought the current ultra version  which very fortunately amazon had on sale \n",
      "this is a very capable microsdhc at a very fair price  i popped it in cell phone  samsung galaxy s   and it got mounted without any hassle  i didn t need any type of formatting  read and write speed is quite fast while using while transferring data to my pc  shipping was fast and tracking it was easy  this a product i highly recommend \n",
      "this thing definitely improved performance over the standard card  transferring music  videos and pictures seem so much more seemless than they were before  prior to this card  i had a   gb standard microsd card that just felt like forever transferring data back and fourth from my phone  i recommend this to anyone who uploads a lot of music and videos onto their mobile devices  transfer rates make up for the slightly higher cost \n",
      "sandisk is now processing my rma   it was used in my galaxy note     its been over a week since i mailed it out  fortunately they paid for shipping  but while it was working  it was awesome      gigabytes of class    accessible data  at the hands of your finger tips  literally micro sd sized   wow  how technology has improved \n",
      "it s an sd card  this one s fast  the read and write speeds are pretty equal on this one  approaching   mbits per second for read and write  i installed linux to this drive for my cubieboard  yeah  read and write speed would definitely be an ultimate determiner of over all system performance with this credit card sized computer sandisk makes nice stuff don t they \n",
      "no formatting needed  plug it in and it just works best buy sells this same card for       they do price matching if you can t wait for this to be shipped \n",
      "installed this in my s  and it was immediately recognized by the phone  i performed a format from the phone just to see what it would do  but it didn t give me any further storage capacity with the card  with card overhead it still adds nearly     gb of storage capacity to my bloated s  i tested moving existing applications  pictures  music  and other files back and forth between my phone and the card  absolutely no problems  if you re not going to put a lot of music  pictures or applications on your phone  you ll probably be fine with no additional storage  however  if you re going to add any storage capacity to your phone  why not maximize it with a   gb card for about     \n",
      "got the sdsdqu    g affp a on december           died on may         could not write to it or change any data  no matter what device i used  even after format  full   quick using disk manager   easeus partition master       home edition  connected in a device or adaptor or usb adaptor  when disconnected and reconnected no change  dropbox saved my data luckily  had it syncing using dropsync pro  was using it with samsung galaxy note   t    for the whole time  never was removed \n",
      "perfect card for so many uses  holds a lot  no skips or blips  nice quality at an affordable price  never had a problem with sandisk and this one is no different \n",
      "i bought this to because i wanted to upload music to the disk for my off the computer listening  this does not support music files so i have no need for this  i ve tried hooking it up with the flash card it came with  i ve tried putting it in my phone and hooking my  phone to the computer  i ve tried through my mp  player   nothing  i can t even get windows media to recognize the flashcard  if you re looking for more storage for portable music don t buy this \n",
      "so  essentially you have about         gb  but it seems to be quite a bit for me  i have yet to use even a quarter of that  and i take pictures every week  i had a problem with how it transferred some videos to my computer once  but that my be because i forgot to format it and prepare my tablet for removal of the sc card it is definitely surprising how small it is  be careful not to lose it \n",
      "works wonderfully  i had this sd for over nine months and it is still working great  i had trouble getting it to recognized at first by my s  formatting from phone and or generic windows format menu did not resolve this issue so i downloaded easeus partition master and formatted and it has been working like charm ever since write speed      mb s   default cache speed read speed       mb s   default cache speed \n",
      "i purchased a samsung        i primarily use as a reading device  i can now place a number of pdf books to chose from   works like a charm \n",
      "i haven t figured out yet if i m a dummy or if i have a defective card   i don t know if the card is bad since i can t even get the card to stay in my samsung galaxy s      the little card will go in  the larger one won t  but it won t stay in   if i put pressure on it the samsung says    preparing sd card but as soon as i release pressure the samsung says      card removed this card came from a source outside of amazon and took way to long to get here   it arrived in a white envelope with no instructions   i m very upset about this purchase as i ve never had a problem before with either sandisk or amazon   i ll try to find someone with more experience than me to give this a try before i return it   i would have expected this to come in a package from sandisk  like other sandisk products i ve bought in big box stores or from amazon but it did not \n",
      "i use these with my gopro hero  and to date i haven t had any issues with them  i have two of these and they record about   hours of video each  so theres more than a day worth of filming you can do these \n",
      "but since i can t say with any certainty whether it was the phone or the card  i ll just say it s a middle of the road product  when it did work though  man it was blazing fast read speed \n",
      "i got this during amazon s sandisk sale   it works like a charm     gb addon to my galaxy s    need i say more \n",
      "bought this memory card to work with mybarnes   noble nook color ebook reader  wifi only it added a much need memory boost to a already great product   i am now able to transfer many more  pdf    epub  and other files to my nook   good job whoever made these things \n",
      "the sd slot on my laptop recognized this card immediately   when i put it in my droid razr maxx it recognized the proper amount but the phone required a reformat since install my phone has had some instability but i haven t had enough time to troubleshoot to determine whether or not it is due to the card   motorola says the phone can handle   gig cards   some users have reported the   gig works fine  other users have reported problems with the   gig card  other than the phone instability the storage on the card seems to be working fine for now \n",
      "good item came well packaged and been working fine so far only thing is it will not connected when using the adapter when connecting it to my pc \n",
      "i got it  formatted it for my phone  and it seems to be working perfectly   i am able to transfer and open files at a good speed  and i have had no problems with it   good product \n",
      "i bought this for only one use  to put in my samsung galaxy s   i popped in the card  mounted and formatted in settings  and it works like a charm in the phone  however it s in caps pay attention    when i took it out of the phone and put the microsd into the sd adapter and plugged into the sd card slot on the front of my pc win  x    it asked to format the card was already formatted by phone so was confused  so i hit ok  no biggie  it was empty anyways  windows did its thing and when it was      ready to use      it said the card was only  mb it showed      gb in the phone   so my troubleshooting section of mind kicked in and i removed the card  and i just so happen to have a microsd slot in my computer s frontal bay and it wouldn t even show it was connected in windows explorer  so i took it out and put in another microsd card  voila it read  switched them out again  and nothing  so i decided to pull up my paragon hard disk utility  and it showed the same thing as windows  regardless how i tried formatting it  i gave up and put it back in the phone and mounted it my s  said it neded to be formatted  so i formatted it in the phone again and it showed just like it did the first time       gb  i then proceeded to install samsung kies and got my phone hooked up to my pc via usb cable  i opened the phone in windows explorer and right there it shows the phone memory at    gb and the sd card at       gb    i m not quite sure what s going on with that  because the sd slots in my pc read my other cards just fine  but anyway i guess if you plan on using it in your phone or possibly other device exclusively because i can use it like a charm while it s in my phone  otherwise it seems pretty useless  so i guess just depends on what you re using it for  on a side not  be careful when you open the plastic package that contains the micro sd and sd adapter  be sure to open it over a large clear area  i opened it up the the living room with black tile floor and had to get a flashlight to find it when it jumped out on the holder it just sets in the little plastic holder so even the slightest shake will send it flying when opening  i m giving it     on here  but     if you re getting it for a phone  galaxy s  at least because it works fine in mine\n",
      "this little sd card is pretty amazing   it is really fast and there was no issues when installing it   it even came with an adapter so you can use it as a regular sd card \n",
      "what can i say     gb in a microsd card     mb s transfer speed while inserted into my laptop  works great in my s   can t really go wrong with this price either \n",
      "i bought this specifically for my cowon j   as it comes with   gb of internal memory  adding   gb got me almost to    gb  that s  x the original capacity that player has this card is formattable to fat    thus allowing you to use it with some of the older sdhc devices  i know not many of the buyers will even consider this ability  but i figured i d throw it there for those that might be interested the card is fast  i d post benchmarks but you can just google for a ton available already  also with   mb s speeds this wouldn t make a bad camera sd card if you absolutely needed one someday  just stick it in the sd adapter and you re rolling i tested it with my canon t i  worked flawlessly  however  not as fast as my other   mb s card \n",

      "i use this on my    gb microsoft surface rt and it does the job as advertised  so   stars i have used it to extend the storage capacity on the tablet to   gb for storing documents  pictures etc  there are many articles on the internet that show you how to do that \n",
      "this chip holds way more than i would normally need but we were going on a three week trip and potentially taking about a million fotos   if you need a large capacity this card was fast for the writes and reads for all the fotos i took   the largest fotos were in the       mb range but most were     mb and there were at least       shots  some were absolute crap but that is the great thing about digifotos  the film is cheap i bought mine here for         and that is still a good price i think for the ability to capture so many fotos and videos  and data if you wish  \n",
      "i own a first generation microsoft surface pro      and it has been a good machine but i was really finding it challenging working within the constraint of    gb of storage space  i had a   gb class    sdxc card  which worked well but was not going to fit the vmware virtual machine i wanted to run off the sd storage  the virtual machine increases in size with regular use  and the operating system i was running is recommended for at least   gb of max storage to operate properly   combined with the files i needed to store  and   gb memory chip was no longer sufficient the sandisk ultra    gb microsdxc class    memory card was able to handle that with ease  however i have found that the virtual machine ran noticeably faster off the   gb chip than this one  i ve actually ordered a second of these to see if i might have just received a flawed chip  if the replacement chip offers improvement i will revise this review  it provides its main selling point  more storage at a relatively low cost  so far has run reliably in my tablet computer if storage space is a significant issue for your device and the memory can make use of    gb sdxc  then i would recommend product \n",
      "this card is great for the price it s exactly what i ordered  works great with my samsung s   plenty of memory \n",

      "while the class    speed is excellent  it s amazing when files will initially transfer at    mb s before settling down to       you do need to use a reader with proper sdxc support  and manually format the card in a good partitioning program  like minitools or easeus  that alone should disqualify it from   stars  for lack of user friendliness  but if it weren t for that  the fast  roomy card is a wonder to own \n",

      "note   please read the last update  scroll to the bottom    i m leaving this review as   star as it appears to help others who purchased and had a similar experience i give sandisk   stars for customer service and   star for the product  for those manufactured in the past   for those newly manufactured products that contain the software rom fix  i d give the product   stars to all those who purchased this card due to all the great reviews     and then used it in a galaxy s   gs   smartphone for storage  the solution to the problem is not one you can solve without returning the card to sandisk for a replacement under warranty   believe me i tried everything that the google searches returned as solutions    formatting as exfat  formatting in the gs  then copying data to the card while in the phone etc     nothing worked    and so now please stop pulling out your hair and hopefully you will get the same result which i hope to get soon  just rma d and will send it back tomorrow for a free replacement under warranty  the problem  as confirmed from the sandisk customer support rep when i asked specifically asked him    when used in the gs   this card will unmount itself inadvertently  may be true only for cards manufactured before the rom patch described below was implemented in manufacturing    this can cause the data to become corrupt  luckily was not my experience  and   or can be very frustrating as most of us are saving    mp camera pictures to the card  or mp  movies that stop in the middle of the movie  and it unmounts when you view the picture in the gallery or worse  right when you take the picture  this was the issue i experienced    sandisk knows about this issue   again  sandisk knows about the issue and will replace your card  call them  info below  and they will take care of it under warranty   they have a good name for a reason and they want to keep it   sorry sandisk about the   star  but i thought it was the way to get the message out to those searching for a solution   the customer rep told me that sandisk tried to work with samsung to resolve the issue but samsung refused to acknowledge a problem exists with this card and some of their phones  especially their flagship gs  phones    the customer rep told me that to their knowledge the card works fine in regular cameras  not samsung gs  phones with cameras  obviously  and even worked fine in some phones from htc etc  that could accommodate the    gb cards  hence the   star ratings from others   the solution sandisk came up with was to write a patch into the rom of the card itself to specifically address the issue on samsung gs  phones  and maybe other samsung phones like the gs     i was assured that the new card i would get would work flawlessly  will see in about   weeks   i purchased my card from amazon june       so the ones currently being manufactured and the one i should get will have the new patch   however  as sandisk manufactures in batches  like most of the industry   old batches of  unpatched  cards obviously exist in warehouses   i asked about a software patch i could download and was told it s not possible    hence the  hard coded patch  in the card s romso    how to take care of the problem    after speaking with the sandisk us customer support  link and info below   this is what i learned and did go to the sandisk site           call consumer products support  this is the us no         sandisk              tell them that the card is unmounting itself in your gs   i assume this is also a problem experienced by gs  owners too    they will then confirm your information  approve your return        min approval window by mine was basically instantaneously   and then send you emails with a ups return label and instructions    btw  they also asked if i had a magnifying glass to id the serial no  on the card  but i didn t and couldn t read it myself  those numbers are super small printed into the plastic    don t believe me   take a look yourself    i told the rep i couldn t read them and he said no problem  they would process without the serial no   i assume this is because they send you a new replacement card only when they receive your card you send in   makes sense well  that s it   problem  hopefully  solved   let s see in     weeks   the rep was super nice about it and seemed like they were all too familiar with the problem   kudos to sandisk for taking care of it    however  it would be nice if there was some type of communication   notice of the issue besides google info sources  forums etc   i spent hours  maybe a couple of days total hours worth  thinking it was an issue with my phone   my data transfer   oh well  that s how it goes i really hope that this review helps some of you out there with the same problem as me   good luck   btw  i d give the card   stars if this problem was solved in the patched rom of newer cards as the data transfer speeds are awesome on the card  tested transferring data via a card reader hooked to my computer     if the data transfer   remaining mounted in the gs  issue never existed  pre patch of rom  of course  update               all went well with the return of the sandisk storage card   ups shipping took about   days from when i sent it  sandisk verified the warranty claim   day later and   hours later that same day  my replacement card had been shipped  waiting on the new card now  but expect to test it out very soon  early next week    will update the post after testing out the new card   just as a reference  i ve been using a   gb micro sd hc sandisk card in the gs  since having shipped the   gb card   obviously it s a different card and not the micro sd xc kind  other than a bit slower access speeds to the card  absolutely zero problems     well if you don t count that it s basically filled up  hence why the   gb option is great on the gs   so it proves the point on the problem with the early build micro sd xc   gb cards i m happy to see that my review has helped some others out there   good luck to you in your warranty claim  my experience with sandisk customer support has been excellent so far update               received the new replacement sandisk storage card just a few days ago  shipping back to me once they agreed it was defective was a very short time window    have had it running in the galaxy s  for a few days now without any jumps  stutters or card unloading in the middle of picture or video taking   card seems to work flawlessly as the sandisk rep mentioned it would  one would think it s such a short time to test after a few days of use  but if this were not fixed already it would have dismounted in the first    minutes    that s how often and how fast it was occurring  so it would seem the problem is solved  the new sd card makes the phone even more responsive when moving between pictures in the gallery and performing other tasks like copying files to the card   thanks sandisk   unless i update this review by next week  you will know that the problem has been fixed good luck to those with similar problems as we now know how to get it fixed thanks to sandisks great responsive customer service update               this is the last update to this review just to  close the loop    the new replacement card from sandisk has been running flawlessly for about   weeks now   i have not experienced any of the initial problems   sandisk really did fix the issues in the new batch of cards update               the card has been running in my gs  flawlessly since replacing it around aug   st   pretty good track record so far        months  so it appears to be fixed with the newly manufactured  replacement  cards for those that have left comments that i should change the rating upwards now that the issue is fixed  see my addition at the beginning of this review     when searching for a solution to a problem with a purchased product  most people start at the   star reviews to see what others have experienced   this is especially true for products with a lot of reviews  this is what i did in the beginning with this product    therefore i think leaving it at   star and adding the comments at the beginning should clarify the review thanks to review commenter  da shocker  for his input   i think he sums it up very well when it comes to the value of files stored on media like this  one more thing   to those not happy with the one star rating by this person go ahead buy one  take tons of pics vids and save some music on there then when the card crashes come back and give it a five star  a card cost          pictures from a vacation or family event are priceless    \n",
      "got this micro data card for a digital camera that shoots in hd  it came with a class   card but the video clips were blocky  i had a class   and tested it in the camera with some improvement and at the advice of youtuber techmoan  this guy does the best tech reviews on the web  i ordered this class    card  it solved the blocky issue and is a great value for the money \n",

      "i bought this for my sony action cam   at    p   fps i get    hrs of recording which is awesome   this card is more than fast enough for that cam   the price was great too   it comes with the regular sd card adapter so don t worry about buying one in addition   the packaging can be difficult to get into though \n",

      "never had a problem with any sd cards prior  and always had a good track record with sandisk products card was working great at first  used exclusively in my samsung galaxy s   enjoyed the extra space got the   gb card  and transfers were pretty quick  i started to see  about a month ago  that the phone would randomly give me  sd card unexpectedly removed  error maybe once a week  the last   weeks  i also started seeing  frequently   sd card safe to remove  randomly pop up at least once a day as well as the  unexpected  removal error every few days  today the card stopped reading all together the card was first inserted w  the phone off  when i bought it  although i never formatted it  it worked properly  i also never removed the card from the phone in order to possibly corrupt it from improper removal  so the card just seems to have died of it s own accord  i never thought to check it s temperature after transferring large files so i m not sure if i had the same issue as another reviewer contacted sandisk  waiting for reply  if they replace the card and it works well  i will revise this review update         got a replacement card after about a week and a half  sandisk supplied a shipping label for me which is always a plus  i ve had the replacement in my s  for     months now and still going strong  i ve also used it with the adapter in my gopro  card is working well and hopefully it continues to do so  updated to   stars since i haven t had a single problem with this card  the first one started showing issues fairly soon after installing   maybe there was just a bad batch of the card for spell there \n",
      "decent price on    gb  works as it should  no problems  not sure if the speeds actually matter with mobile devices  maybe for transferring media to pc faster actually helps  either way  it works great \n",

      "the   gb card i purchased actually contains  gb of flash memory and some kind of hack that causes it to appear as a   gb drive in various drives and readers  of course  this took me a while to figure out since i only just got around to copying more than  gb of data to the card  but with some testing i have nonetheless discovered this to be the case the card i bought was in amazon frustration free packaging  i don t know if cards purchased that way are less likely to be counterfeit than retail packaged versions  but i suspect that i will stick with manufacturer packaging from now on \n",
      "i have purchased   of these cards   i have attempted to use them in my gopro herohd  samsung galaxy s   asus tf     and in all of them they end up corrupting out of the blue with no warning   i then have to perform a deep recovery to get the files   i will never buy these ultra models again \n",
      "had to send it back to sandisk   they did replace it at no cost   which is nice   but still     if i had lost a bunch of data i would have been pretty bummed   i used it in my phone to store music   one day i turned on my phone and it said      can t read card       that was it   i tried putting it in my computer to reformat  wasn t even recognized as a drive at all \n",

      "while sandisk s packaging makes much mention of android phones and tablets  there s nothing android specific about this microsdhc card  i bought the   gb version to use in an automotive  dashcam   where it works perfectly the packaging also says that an android app is  included   suggesting it is preinstalled on the card  but the  very   fine print on the back says you have to download it  unlike another sandisk flash product i got recently  there was no  bloatware  preinstalled on the card i like that this card is also said to be resistant to temperature extremes  important to me as it will be behind a car windshield and will get hot at times \n",

      "with most of the world s electronic devices finally standardizing to sd  thank you sony for finally adopting this standard   it seems most things we own work on either the microsd or regular sd card   that s why this little package is so handy   you get both in one neat little package and at   gb  you ll have plenty of space to store most of your programs  files  etc on your device the class    rating  ability to move data on off card at the current maximum speed  is a must for anyone that doesn t want to sit for vital seconds waiting for data to write to the card   and sandisk has proven themselves over the years as making a quality product   sure  you may occasionally find a dud in their inventory  but they are quick to fix replace it and that is what matters most   buying cheaper cards will land you with a read write error when you can least afford it   don t be the person that loses those important family photos or that document that is due today because of a cheap and defective card i purchased this particular card for my asus transformer  as it fits nicely into the pad itself   and with the optional keyboard attachment  which is capable of holding standard sd cards  it fits there as well   making this the perfect solution for my extra memory needs and at a much better bargain than most competitors   you can certainly purchase more internal memory on your iproduct or android device  most seem to have   gb or   gb variants   but why spend the extra cash for   gb extra  when you can buy far more in an external card \n",

      "so i got this sd specifically for my gopro black     simply hoping it would work since the gopro manual says      use cards up to   gb      and the sandisk says it s good for cell phones and tablets  yet doesn t mention the gopro well  turns out it works perfect  and although i haven t tried it on other devices  i think if it works flawlessly on the gopro  it will work even better on anything else   so at first i thought maybe since it s only   mbps there may be frame rate issues with recording  even though i knew that shouldn t be the case   well after popping it in  the gopro says  hr  min      p super view video  which is insane  i put it on my helmet and took it for a spin  when i came home after spending the day on the bike  the hd quality was spectacular  granted it s all thanks to the camera itself   but it was smooth  with zero frame rate issues  the only flaw is the semi long time it takes to copy files to your hard drive as it copies at only   mbps  but honestly that s really no big deal and totally worth it still bottom line  this sd plus the gopro    is the best camera combination for your money p s  it s small  simple  durable  and has no lock feature  which i always found to be an annoyance anyway  any questions please feel free to comment  and i will do my best to answer \n",

      "once you cut and pry your way through sandisk s packaging  you will be rewarded with a nicely made and high performing microsd uhs  flash memory   it comes formatted to sd org s standards in fat    so it s ready to go for most applications   my single gripe about this product is that they have omitted the usual small plastic box that holds the card and adapter   i use those   since i frequently switch cards between uses  and frequently have them in storage  those little boxes are very useful   it s way too easy to lose a microsd anyway  here are the results from atto disk benchmark settings  anticipating digicam use   total length   mb overlapped i o and qd    but it never exceeds   segment size in kbytes  read write in kbyte secsize  write  read                                                                                                                                                                                                                   sorry for the ugly table  amazon does not support consecutive spaces  including alt      or embedded tabs this is very fast for a microsd   it s not quite up to what sandisk achieves in full size uhs  sd cards that can write over twice this speed  but those are electronically more complex cards  the micro form factor likely doesn t permit the additional hardware to achieve speeds comparable to the larger cards   note that the read speed is a lot faster than what sandisk promises    note also that you will not achieve these speeds with a usb  reader   you will need either a usb  or built in pcie reader to get accurate results   so do not complain to me if you use a usb  reader and don t achieve these speeds  in any event  you d be hard pressed to find anything faster my personal experience with sandisk products is very good   that is  i ve never had anything fail on me   given the very reasonable prices of these  i rate them as highly recommended \n",

      "maybe there is nothing that can be done and it is just the way the technology is at this time  but to me it seems that the   gb sd cards have very limited uses at this time because they are formatted in whats called  exfat    instead of the standard fat   to get   gb from a   gb card   after receiving my card and inserting it into my new android tablet with  jelly bean  it was recognized and it did show i had   gb available   i then removed the card from the tablet and inserted it into my computers  a win  and a vista  and tried to transfer files  photos and videos from my laptop to the card they would not transfer   after some research on the internet it appeared that the card had to be reformatted from the new  exfat    to the standard fat     all my files were created in win xp and win vista   fat     i also have a win  machine i recently purchased and can easily move all types of files between all the machines and memory cards and flash drives but could not transfer any files to this card from any computer as long as the card was formatted in exfat     i had read on the internet about reformatting  the cards and it working   my win  machine does not even have the option to format to standard fat    it only has nstf and exfat     my older computers have the older fat   format option and it took my vista computer with a dual core processor    hours to reformat the card to fat     after reformatting i was able to easily transfer my files  photos  and videos on my xp and vista computers but not the win  computer   the card works in my tablet and i am able to access and use all the files i transferred to the card in fat   with my vista computer on the tablet   but after reformatting it now the card only has   gb of space available  so it was essentially reformatted the   gb card into a   gb card   i will keep the card because i have a lot of work into it reformatting and transferring files and hopefully in the future i can reformat it again back to exfat   if and when exfat   catches on and an os is made that can seamlessly use files created in both fat   and exfat     this seems to be a good card that works well in certain situations but my advice do your research on what you have and how you will use the card because this is not simply a big gb card that can be used for everything in every device  unless all your files  photos  and videos are in  or will be created with  exfat   there are some real draw backs to this card and you might be better off just buying multiple lower gb cards if you really need this much storage space in a micro sd card   or perhaps cards you already own can be reformatted into exfat   and double the capacity if your computer has the exfat   reformat option   i have not tried it but based on my experience the last few days it seems like it would work if exfat   works for you  i gave   stars because it does work  but i feel sandisk not fully explaining how they are getting   gb out of this card and the possible problems a consumer might have with it is misleading advertising \n",

      "monday  november         i put this in the galaxy s  without formatting  restarted the phone and it showed     g gb of space   i transferred all the files from the old    gb card and then moved all my music to the card with the phone connected to my computer by the usb cord   still lots of space left and the various music players seem to see all the music tuesday  november         the card didn t show up on the phone this afternoon   no message  just no songs to play and no card according to everything i could check on the phone   i restarted the phone and got a notification that the sd card was corrupt  needed formatting and that i would loose all data on the card   i restarted the phone again  without formatting  and the card came up like it had never been missing   i am writing this on thursday        and i have not had another issue with the card december  well  i don t know what to think   the card disappeared again and i reformatted it fat   in an attempt to fix the problem   the whole point of getting this large card was to have my music on my phone and not have to stream it from the cloud   i tried several music players and went with poweramp because of the good reviews and that i could specify the folder to play from   so poweramp is looking for the folder  mnt extsdcard music and playing the songs in all the subfolders   it is poweramp that tells me that folder is not available the card has gone missing one other time and restarting the phone fixed the problem today  poweramp would not play and when i got home i found the music folder was gone   i also had ringtones folder and it was also gone   now  i may not be the sharpest saw in the shed  but i know i did not delete those folders   the card had other folders but not those two so it had not been reformatted i am starting to think the problem is with the galaxy s    i had a    gb fat   card in this phone that had been in my previous htc phone   that card was not large enough to held my music so i don t know if it was disappearing or not   i wish this combination of phone and   gb card was more reliable but just don t know where the problem lies i lowered the stars from   to   but i really don t know if the problem is with the card  the phone or both   all i know is that they do not seem to be playing well together december  there was a notification on the phone this morning that the sd card was corrupted and needed to be formatted   i restarted the phone several times and got the notification each time   i reformatted the sd card using the phone  a step i don t think i have tried yet december  another minor problem i have is that the message counter gets stuck on   when i have no new messages   the only fix i have found is to restart the phone   that happened this morning and i got the corrupted card message again  but restarted again and the card came up ok december   so  the files on the card keep disappearing   the card is mounted and the phone shows the correct free memory but poweramp  and file directory programs do not see any files on the card   i restart the phone and the files come back   very strange   i played music on and off all day today without a problem and then this evening all the files disappeared again  restarted the phone and all is well again december   my phone upgraded to       yesterday and the same issues remain   it is a crap shoot as to if music will play   i take a lot of photos and use the service zenfolio to store and display them   i have an app that syncs with zenfolio and keeps a phone size version of the photos on my phone   i set this app to store the photos on the samsung sd card and have similar issues with it when the data on the phone goes away   this morning the sd card came up as corrupt again after a restart to get the data back   it took a total of   restarts to get the music and photos back december   i have been trying to play music stored on this card today and my phone has reset several times   very frustrating   i ordered a sandisk    gb mobile microsdhc flash memory card sdsdq    g affp today for about        and i ll see if i have the same issues   very disappointing december   i purchased and installed thesandisk    gb mobile microsdhc flash memory card sdsdq    g affpand copied all the files from the   gb card to the new   gb card   no formatting  no fuss  no muss   i have not had a phone reset since  have played music through bluetooth for hours in the car  have viewed photos   everything just works   half the memory but what i have is always available and the phone works  a good trade off   i am still disappointed that the   gb did not work with the sg    i have purchased aelago mobile nano ii usb     microsdhc flash memory card reader  black to use the   gb microsdhc card as a thumb drive \n",

      "i really don t know what to think about this i got it thinking it would solve my memory problems but that s not the case turns out you can only put certain things on this and of course none of the thingsthat are eating up your memory on your will go there is a way to swap your internal memory for your external card but it s not easy and you have to root  your phone\n",
      "so i recently got a new chinese brand android phone  inew i       quadcore    mp camera   gb ram    gb internal storage   microsd support  also comes with app sd software support as well i had an old samsung class      gb and tested that it works with the i      but wasn t enough for a power user like me decided to give it the extra storage boost with the sandisk   gb class     i now hold within   gb music collection  mp  s at      kbps   gb of graphic novels manga manwhabooks with a manga app reader gb of apps  migrate the core apps from internal storage to external storage  gb of photos taken with the phone  uses microsd as storage for photos    gb of free space left for downloading movies mp s and documents on the goi love this little card  its fantastic and a great way to add some serious expandable storage onto any smartphone that supports the storage fyi  i had to format the sandisk   gb card using my smartphone  i      in order for it to set the microsd to fat    don t use the pc laptop to do the format  it will mess it up was debating between class    sandisk   gb or class    samsung   gb  i decided to throw my lot in with the       reviews for sandisk with an average customer rating of     stars  samsung had     stars but was from    people  so lol highly recommend this to others \n",
      "this is pretty cheap i wish the   gb one had been on sale but this one was priced at about    dollars so i can t argue  i have this in my nokia lumia      and there is no lag i love this card should have purchased more \n",
      "what not to like  works as specified  recognized correctly when placed in my phone  adapter may come in handy in future \n",
      "i purchased the sandisk ultra   gb microsdhc for some extra storage room for my samsung galaxy note      tablet  i was considering the    gb  but went with this card because i have the   gb version on my galaxy note   phone and i have never come close to needing all that space  granted  i don t store any music on my phone but i do take a lot of photos videos and store as many apps on the microsdhc card rather than use the phone s internal memory for the cost savings of going with the smaller   gb card  it was a no brainer the card has worked flawlessly since i installed it on my tablet and have had no problems with it whatsoever  plus sandisk is a big name in storage so again  it s a no brainer    buy it \n",
      "do not put any important data in it  do not use it as a permanent storage to archive important files it just failed after     months use    i don t use it too much  just put all my digital pictures  total  about   gb  in it and carried in my wallet  i added some more pictures to the disk for a few time in november  tonight  when i insert it into my laptop  windows say cannot recognize the disk and said it must be formatted  i tried my macbook air and got the same  neither mac nor windows can read it  i formatted it and started to copy the    gb pictures again  the copy broke in half way  cancelled the copy  reinserted the disk and tried to resume the copy  windows said the volumn is back and told me i must run chkdsk  i ran chkdsk and retried the copy  still the same failure i guess the disk has some problem and i don t bother recovering it  since it s not going to be reliable as i expected  very disappointed  thought sandisk is a very good brand  i use sandisk s cf card in my camera for years and it worked fine  i will fall back to use hard disk to backup my ditigal pictures so it should be find to use this microsd disk to exchange some large file with friends  but don t put important data in it  be prepard that it can fail at any time \n",
      "so far so good  i use this with my mobil phone and the product run smoothly  no issue as of yet  overall  i m happy with this product \n",
      "it worked just like you would expect a micro sd card to work  no noticeable issues have come up yet \n",
      "microsd card works flawlessly with my digital video recorder   no problems at all with playback   more words needed for official review \n",
      "i really wanted a     gb card  but at less than half the price  as well as actually being in stock right now  this is a good buy  and works well  i couldn t find anyone that would say for sure when i was looking to buy  but this is compatible with mac \n",
      "i bought this to stretch the capability of my lg gpad     gpe tablet it is working just fine and of course i have total confidence in sandisk storage items \n",
      "i bought this sandisk   gb class    to use with my htc inspire  after   months  i am getting constant error saying sd card unmounted unexpectedly then today  the dang fkang card won t even read in the card reader  i have   gb worth of videos and pictures  memories that i will never be able to get back  i am very upset \n",
      "used this for extending the capabilities of my samsung galaxy note      it greatly expands it use and was a snap to install and get started with it \n",
      "great card that is very fast and reliable  it comes with an optional adapter for sd slots  being that this is a class    card it transfers data really fast and for video this is a must  great for gopros and other small cameras alike \n",
      "good amount of space for the stuff i want to do  and fits in my gopro  what more can i say \n",
      "i ve heard bad things about this   gb micro sd card crapping out after a few weeks but sk far so good  transfer speeds are normal but i like to be space  for the price it was a steal would recommend \n"
